This thesis has two focuses.
The first part focuses on the structure of HIV-1 Tat perturbed membranes
composed of neutral lipids dioleoylphosphatidylcholine.

The second part focuses on the structure of the asymmetric ripple phase formed
by dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipids. Our high resolution electron density 
profile in the major arm obtained via the low angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) analysis
agreed well with that of the gel $L_{\beta'}$ phase, showing that the chains 
in the major arm are gel-like. The interpretion was further supported by 
our wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) analysis with the thin rod model developed
for the ripple major arm chains, which suggested that the chains were in the 
$L_{\beta F}$ phase.
The LAXS analysis also showed clear distinction between the major and minor arm electron
density profiles, supporting the coexistence of different molecular organizations
in the ripple phase. The minor arm electron density profile qualitatively
agreed with the interdigitated chains proposed by a MD simulation. However, the 
WAXS data were inconsistent with the proposed chain packing, but consistent 
with fluid-like chains.
