\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis has two focuses, both in the area of biomembranes.
One focus is on the interaction of a biomedically important Tat peptide with 
membranes.
The other is on a fundamental problem regarding the enigmatic structure of a
pure lipid bilayer.
Sec.~\ref{sec:lipid_bilayer} introduces lipid molecules that constitute
biomembranes and three thermodynamic phases displayed by lipids pertinent to this 
thesis.
The Tat peptide and its biomedical importance are introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:Tat_peptide},
followed by a brief overview of the ripple phase in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_phase}.


\section{Lipid bilayer}\label{sec:lipid_bilayer}
%Protein function essential for living organisms is regulated by cell membranes. 
Membranes define the boundary between living cells
and their surrounding environment, and from this position help 
regulate intercellular transport. 
The lipid bilayer is the structural backbone of biomembranes.
Lipid bilayers are a self-assembly of lipids, which are 
amphiphilic molecules that consist of a hydrophilic headgroup
and hydrophobic chains (Fig.~\ref{fig:lipid}).

\end{figure}

In water, lipids self-assemble into lipid bilayers to shield their hydrophobic 
chains, and display a wide variety of thermodynamic phases
as a function of temperature and hydration. Figure~\ref{fig:phase_diagram}
shows a phase diagram of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (\gls{DMPC}).
Phosphatidylcholines (\gls{PC}) lipids constitute a substantial fraction of cell membranes
and have been studied for many decades \cite{Nagle00}.
At full hydration (100\% relative humidity), a lamellar phase coexists with excess water.
In the high temperature, fluid $L_\alpha$ phase, the hydrocarbon chains 
are conformationally disordered, and intra-membrane molecular correlations 
are liquid-like \cite{ref:Fahey78} (Fig.~\ref{fig:various_phases}).
The disorder of fluid phase membranes allows proteins to 
interact with cell membranes in various ways, rendering biological systems
highly complex. 
This phase is usually considered the most biologically relevant.

\end{figure}

In the low temperature, gel $L_{\beta'}$
phase, hydrocarbon chains are stiff and tilted with respect to the membrane
normal \cite{ref:Tardieu73} and are organized in either a hexagonal 
or orthorhombic lattice (Fig.~\ref{fig:various_phases}). 
The $L_{\beta'}$ phase is further categorized into three phases according to the 
chain tilt direction \cite{ref:Smith88,ref:Tristram93,Tristram-Nagle02}. 
In the \LbetaI\ phase, chains are tilted toward the 
nearest neighbor as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_phase_packing}, and
in the \LbetaF\ phase, chains are tilted toward the next nearest neighbor.
In the \LbetaL\ phase, chains are tilted toward an intermediate direction
between nearest and next nearest neighbors.

  ($\phi=0$). In the \LbetaL\ phase, $0 \leq \phi \leq \pi/2$.}

\end{figure}

There are various kinds of lipids. They can be 
categorized in terms of headgroup, chain saturation, and chain length.
The most studied headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (\gls{PC}),
consisting of phosphate and choline molecular groups. 
Lipid hydrocarbon chains can have one or more double bonds. 
Lipids
with no double bonds in the chains are called saturated lipids,
such as DMPC (see Fig.~\ref{fig:lipid_structure}) and diphosphatidylcholines (\gls{DPPC}). 
Lipids with one double bond
are called mono-unsaturated lipids, such as dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (\gls{DOPC}) shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lipid_structure}.
Unsaturation leads to chain packing frustration and lowers the melting 
temperature. 
For example, at full hydration DOPC forms a $L_{\alpha}$ fluid phase at room temperature
while DPPC is in a $L_{\beta'}$ gel phase.
In mammalian cells, most lipids have at least one unsaturated chain.
Membrane curvature has interested many physicists. 
Phosphatidylethanolamine (\gls{PE}) is a small 
headgroup, and packing of PE lipids leads to spontaneous membrane curvature.
The chemical structure of dioleoylphosphatidylechanolamine (\gls{DOPE}) is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lipid_structure}.
Many proteins have been found to sense/induce membrane curvature, 
making PE lipids especially attractive for those studies \cite{ref:Chernomordik03}.
Another class of headgroup is
anionic, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). 
In cells, electrostatic interactions
significantly influence biological processes and naturally occurring anionic
lipids have been the focus of many studies \cite{ref:Dowhan97}.

\section{Tat peptide}\label{sec:Tat_peptide}
The transactivator of translation (\gls{Tat}),
an important protein for HIV-1 infection,
is produced by the HIV-1 Tat regulatory gene.
After synthesis on the HIV-1 RNA, Tat protein enters a cell's nucleus where it is a
transcriptional transactivator for the long terminal repeat
promoter which acts by binding to the Tar RNA element \cite{Vaishnav91}
(Fig.~\ref{fig:HIV_lifecycle}).
More recently, it was discovered that Tat participates in RNA
initiation by stimulating the transcription complex \cite{Raha05}.
Both of these roles activate the HIV virus and increase viral loads.
One focus of current AIDS research is to eradicate reservoirs of 
infected memory T-cells that contain dormant HIV;
Tat can awaken latent provirus \cite{Macias09}.
An understanding of Tat transport could lead to new or more effective 
HIV treatments. Tat could be prevented from
reaching the nuclear genome. Tat could awaken dormant virus so that
it can be targeted by standard treatments that only
work on active virus \cite{Macias09}. 

Of the 86 amino acids in Tat,
the highly basic (Y$_{47}$GRKKRRQRRR$_{57}$) sequence called Tat peptide 
is essential to transport
a Tat protein through the nuclear membrane \cite{Ruben89,Hauber87}. 
Mutations within
this region yield a Tat protein that does not penetrate the cell 
nucleus. Tat peptide membrane translocation efficiency 
has made it a model for peptide-aided protein and drug delivery
\cite{Futaki01}. 
The mechanism of Tat-peptide translocation of proteins, 
DNA, RNA, and drugs across the membrane is of considerable interest
since it is known that desolvating and moving charged groups across membranes
can be energetically prohibitive \cite{Grabe04}. 
It has been suggested by \gls{MD} (molecular dynamics) simulations that Tat peptide first binds rather
more deeply in the membrane, below the phosphates, than
would be anticipated for such a highly charged peptide. From that position,
Tat may electrostatically attract the phosphates in the distal monolayer
leading to the formation of a transient water-filled pore through which
proteins and drugs diffuse \cite{Herce07}. 
We studied the transverse location of Tat within model lipid membranes 
by X-ray scattering
combined with MD simulations. This study is described in chapter 2.

\section{$P_{\beta'}$ ripple phase}\label{sec:ripple_phase}
For some lipids, a height modulated phase where
bilayers are no longer flat exists between the fluid and gel phases
(Fig.~\ref{fig:phase_diagram}). 
This phase was termed $P_{\beta'}$ 
and is commonly called the ripple phase \cite{ref:Tardieu73}. 
The $P_{\beta'}$--$L_{\beta'}$ transition is often
called the pre-transition \cite{ref:Wack89} or lower transition \cite{Nagle00}.
The ripple phase has fascinated many researchers in condensed matter physics
and physical chemistry as an example of periodically modulated phases,
with many theoretical papers attempting to explain the height modulation
\cite{ref:Doniach79,ref:Marder84,ref:Hawton86,ref:Carlson87,ref:Goldstein88,ref:McCullough90,ref:Honda91,ref:Lubensky93,ref:Sengupta01,ref:Kamal11}
and a few simulation papers investigating molecular organization 
\cite{ref:deVries05,ref:Lenz07,ref:Scott84,ref:Debnath09}.
%From an accurate ripple structure, some indication of the energetcis of the ripple 
%formation may be obtained by comparing the relative size of the ripple wavelength
%and the ripple amplitude to the size of lipid molecules and the bilayer thickness 
%\cite{ref:Goldstein88}.
Despite many systematic studies over the past three decades
\cite{ref:Tardieu73,ref:Janiak76,ref:Copeland80,ref:Ruppel83,ref:Zasadzinski87,ref:Wack89,ref:Sun96,ref:Katsaras00,ref:Sengupta03}, 
molecular details of the structure are still lacking, which impedes
theoretical understanding of its origin.

Studies of the ripple phase are normally done on multilamellar systems, but
some works have reported the existence of the ripple phase in unilamellar vesicles
\cite{ref:Mason99,ref:Parente84}.
Most studies have been performed on PCs \cite{Nagle00}.
PCs have a fairly bulky headgroup, creating a size mismatch with its acyl chains,
especially below the main phase transition. This is believed to be the 
reason why the acyl chains are tilted in the gel phase of PCs \cite{Nagle00,ref:Mcintosh80,ref:Nagle76}.
It has been proposed that the driving force for the ripple formation is also 
coupled to this size mismatch, with headgroup hydration playing an important role
\cite{ref:Cevc91,ref:Carlson87}.
It is not yet established whether the chains are tilted 
with respect to the local bilayer normal in the ripple phase \cite{ref:Sun96}.

Generally, it is assumed that the lipids in the ripple phase are mainly in all-trans
configuration, as in the gel phase \cite{ref:Sengupta03}.
However, many studies point to the coexistence of fluid and gel regions
\cite{ref:Wittebort81,ref:Schneider83,ref:Sun96,ref:Marsh80,ref:Cunningham98,ref:Rappolt00}.
An X-ray structural study has reported that the ripples are composed of 
a longer sawtooth arm with characteristics similar to a gel phase
and a shorter arm that is thinner and less densely packed\cite{ref:Sun96}, 
more compatible with a fluid phase or with a more recently proposed
interdigitated \LI\ phase.
Changes of bilayer packing along the ripple direction were also reported in
molecular dynamics simulations \cite{ref:deVries05}.
Yet, coexistence of different bilayer packings has not been established.
 

We studied the electron density distribution and chain packing 
of the asymmetric DMPC ripple phase formed by an oriented multilamellar sample
using synchrotron low and wide angle X-ray scattering.
An advantage of studying multilamellar (as opposed to unilamellar) systems with X-rays 
is out-of-plane diffraction peaks that can be analyzed to determine a detailed
bilayer structure \cite{ref:Sun96,ref:Sengupta03}.
An oriented sample also yields anisotropic
in-plane chain correlation scattering 
that can be analyzed to elucidate the molecular organization within 
the rippling bilayers, as was successfully done for the gel phase 
\cite{ref:Tardieu73,ref:Smith88,ref:Tristram93}.
Our aim was to study whether all-trans chains are tilted with respect to 
the local bilayer normal and to elucidate the coexistence of different bilayer packings.
My ripple study is presented in chapter 3.
