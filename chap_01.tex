\section{Lipid bilayer}
In biological system, cell membranes define the boundary of living organism
and surrounding environment. They regulate what can come and leave living
cells. Building blocks of cell membranes are lipid bilayers.
Lipid bilayers are self-assembled system of lipids, which are 
amphiphilic molecules, consisting of a hydrophilic headgroup
and hydrophobic chains (Fig.~\ref{fig:lipid}).

In water lipids self-assemble into lipid bilayes to shield their hydrophobic 
cores, and 
display a wide variety of thermodynamic phases
as a function of temperature and hydration. Figure~\ref{fig:phase_diagram}
shows a phase diagram of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholines (DMPC).
PC lipids constitute a substantial fraction of cell membranes
and have been studied for many decades.
At full hydration, a lamellar phase coexists with excess water.
In the high temperature, fluid L$_\alpha$ phase, the hydrocarbon chains 
are conformationally disordered, and intra-membrane molecular correlations 
are liquid-like \cite{ref:Fahey78} (Fig.~\ref{fig:various_phases}).
Disordering and flexibility of fluid phase membranes allow them to 
interact with proteins in various ways, leading to the complex nature
of biological systems. 
This phase is usually considered biologically relevant, making it
the most widely studied phase for understanding various biological processes.

  \LbetaI, \LbetaL, and \LbetaF\ belong to the gel L$_{\beta'}$ phase. P$_{\beta'}$ is 
  the ripple phase and L$_\alpha$ is the fluid phase.}

  and solid lines are lipid chains. $\theta_t$ is the chain tilt angle.}

In the low temperature, gel L$_{\beta'}$
phase, hydrocarbon chains are stiff and titled with respect to the membrane
normal \cite{ref:Tardieu73}, and are organized in a either hexagonal 
or orthorhombic lattice. 
The L$_{\beta'}$ is further categorized into three phases according to the 
chain tilt direction \cite{ref:Smith88}. 
In the L$_{\beta\text{I}}$ phase, chains are titled toward the 
nearest neighbor as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_phase_packing}, and
in the \LbetaF\ phase, chains are titled toward the next-next nearest neighbor.
In the \LbetaL\ phase, chains are tilted toward an intermediate direction.

  Unit cells are shown in dashed lines.
  Chains are drawn as solid lines. Chains are tilted toward the
  nearest neighbor in \LbetaI\ phase with $\phi=\pi/2$. 
  In \LbetaF\ phase, they are titled toward the next-next nearest neighbor
  ($\phi=0$). In \LbetaL\ phase, $\phi$ can be anywhere between 0 and $\pi/2$.}

Between the fluid and gel phases appears a height modulated phase where
bilayers are no longer flat (Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_cartoon}). 
The low angle diffraction pattern of this phase conforms to the symmetry
of a two dimensional monoclinic lattice. This phase was termed P$_\beta'$ 
and is commonly
called the ripple phase. The P$_{\beta'}$--L$_{\beta'}$ transition is often
called the pre-transition.
The topography of the membrane ripples has been directly
visualized by freeze fracture electron microscopy experiments 
\cite{ref:Luna77,ref:Copeland80,ref:Ruppel83,ref:Zasadzinski87,ref:Zasadzinski88}.
The wavelength of the modulation is about 140 \AA\ for 
dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC),
which has 14 carbons in the hydrocarbon chains \cite{ref:Wack89}.
There has been evidence that molecular conformation in the ripple phase is not 
unique. NMR signals in the ripple phase \cite{ref:Wittebort81} were consistent
with a superposition of signals observed in the fluid and gel phases.
Lateral diffusion measurements found two distinct populations,
with diffusion coefficients characteristic of fluid and gel phases
\cite{ref:Schneider83}.

  bilayers assume periodic height modulation with a sawtooth shape.
  The longer side of a sawtooth is called major arm and the shorter
  side is called minor arm. It is generally assumed that chains are
  in all trans conformation in the major arm, but the molecular packing
  in the minor arm is not known.}

There are various kinds of lipids. They can be 
categorized in terms of headgroup, chain saturation, and chain length.
The most studied headgroup is a phosphatidylcholine (PC),
consisting of phosphate and choline groups. Another class of headgroup is
anionic, phosphatidylserin (PS). In cells, electrostatic interaction 
greatly influence biological processes and naturally occurring anionic
lipids have been a focus of studies. More recently, membrane curvature
has attracted many physicists. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a small 
headgroup, and packing of PE lipids leads to spontaneous membrane curvature.
Many proteins have been found to sense/induce membrane curvature, 
making PE lipids especially attractive for those studies.
Lipid hydrocarbon chains can have one or more double bonds. Lipids
with no double bonds in the chains are called saturated lipids.
An example of such lipids is DMPC and DPPC. DPPC at room temperature
forms a L$_{\beta'}$ gel phase.
Lipids with one double bond
are called mono-unsaturated lipids. Examples of such lipids are DOPC.
Unsaturation lead to packing frustration and lower the melting 
temperature. DOPC at room temperature forms a L$_{\alpha}$ fluid phase.
In mammalian cells, unsaturated chains make up a large number.
For example, in plasma membranes,

\section{Tat}
we investigated the interaction of Tat peptide with lipid bilayers. 
This study is discussed in chapter 2.

\section{ripple}
we measured the electron density profile of the lipid
bilayers using a stack of oriented bilayers. Using wide angle x-ray scattering
technique, we also investigated the chain packing within a bilayer. 
The ripple phase is discussed in chapter 3.
