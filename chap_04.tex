\chapter{Ripple Phase}
In this chapter, I discuss the chain packing in the DMPC ripple phase. 
I should probably copy a lot of stuff from my old report.

\section{Low Angle Diffraction Experiment}
\subsection{Model}
Sun, Senguputa, etc.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

\section{Wide Angle}
\subsection{Near Grazing Angle Experiment}
Plot along the peak, along the arc, horizontal, vertical, etc.

\subsection{Transmission Experiment}
No strong order on the equator. Subtraction of water scattering from the
background image.

\subsection{How much can I say about chain packing?}
Major arm? Minor arm?

\subsection{Model}


\section{Discussion}
Comparison with previous unoriented/oriented stuff?

Which theories are consistent/inconsistent with the results of this study?


\section{Conclusion}
