\section{Introduction}\label{sec:ripple_introduction}
\subsection{Some Historical Detail}
In the first structural study of the ripple phase by Tardieu \textit{et al.},
the crystallographic phase factor for the X-ray diffraction peaks from 
dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (\acs{DLPC}) were obtained
by a pattern recognition technique, and an electron density map was calculated
\cite{ref:Tardieu73}. 
In this chapter, ``phase'' is used to refer to two different ideas: a thermodynamic phase
and a crystallographic phase factor (the crystallographic phase factor is described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_models}).
Tardieu \textit{et al.} concluded that the structure
corresponds to a 2D monoclinic unit cell shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:unit_cell}.
The calculated 
electron density map showed that DLPC bilayers are height modulated
and have asymmetric shape. 
The ripple wavelength \gls{lambdar} was reported to be 85.3 \AA, 
the lamellar periodicity \gls{D} = 55.3 \AA, the oblique angle
\gls{gamma} = 110\textdegree, and ripple amplitude \gls{A} = 15 \AA.

Various experiments have indicated the existence of two types of ripple phases:
the stable asymmetric and the metastable symmetric phase. In the asymmetric
phase, there is inversion symmetry
which restricts the phase factors to $\pm$1.
In the metastable symmetric phase, there is only 
a plane of reflection perpendicular to the ripple wavevector \gls{a2},
so the phase factors may be complex. 
The metastable symmetric phase has been observed in DPPC bilayers, but not
in DMPC \cite{ref:Koynova96,ref:Katsaras00}.

The equilibrium structure of the ripple phase in multilamellar samples has been 
extensively studied by
X-ray diffraction \cite{ref:Janiak76,ref:Janiak79,ref:Tardieu73,ref:Wack89,ref:Yao91,ref:Sun96,ref:Cunningham98,
ref:Sengupta99,ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03},
neutron diffraction \cite{ref:Mortensen88,ref:Bradshaw89,ref:Mason99}, 
freeze fracture electron microscopy \cite{ref:Woodward96,ref:Copeland80,ref:Ruppel83},
and freeze fracture scanning tunneling microscopy \cite{ref:Zasadzinski88} techniques.
In the scanning tunneling microscopy experiment \cite{ref:Zasadzinski88}, 
the three-dimensional contours of the ripple phase $P_{\beta'}$ of
DMPC were imaged.

While many studies have used multilamellar samples, the ripple phase has been reported
to also exist in large unilamellar vesicles \cite{ref:Mason99,ref:Parente84}
%{\color{red}calorimetric study by Biltonen and others},
and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) \cite{ref:Li06}. 
In a GUV composed of a mixture of DPPC and 
dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (\acs{DOPC}), 
coexisting domains of $L_\beta'$ and $P_\beta'$ have been observed \cite{ref:Li06}.
However, X-ray structural studies using ULVs or GUVs are ambiguous
because of the absence of out-of-plane diffraction peaks. 

The ripple phase has been detected in
phosphatidylcholines (\acs{PC}) and phosphatidylglycerol (\acs{PG}),
%{\jn REF},
but no ripple phase has been observed in bilayers composed entirely of 
phosphatidylethanolamine (\acs{PE}) headgroups.
These studies suggest that headgroup size influences
ripple formation. Indeed, the size mismatch
between the bulky PC headgroup and hydrocarbon chains lead to tilt of 
the chains in the gel phase \cite{ref:Nagle76,ref:Mcintosh80,Nagle00}. 
Bilayers' tendency toward the ripple phase was also observed by including PG lipids.
In the study by Li \textit{et al.}, where  
coexisting domains of $L_\beta'$ and $P_\beta'$ were found \cite{ref:Li06},
the $P_\beta'$ domain had a lower concentration of DPPC than the $L_\beta'$
domain. 
Addition of anionic lipid \acs{DOPG} caused the size of the ripple domains
to grow at the expense of the gel domains. The authors concluded that reduction of 
surface tension drove highly stressed gel phase to less stressed ripple phase.
Thus, headgroups strongly influence the formation of the ripple phase.

From X-ray data of the DMPC ripple of unoriented samples, 
Wack and Webb \cite{ref:Wack89} argued that the ripples have a sawtooth shape
but were unable to phase the observed reflections.
Their intensity data were later
phased by employing a modeling and fitting technique by Sun \textit{et al.}
\cite{ref:Sun96}, and the electron density map was calculated, which indicated that  
the ripples indeed have a sawtooth shape with a longer side called the major arm
and a shorter side called the minor arm (see Fig.~\ref{fig:unit_cell}). 
The map also showed that the major arm is about twice as long as the minor arm. 
The major arm thickness perpendicular to the membrane plane 
was found to be larger than the corresponding minor arm thickness. 
The value of the bilayer thickness in the major arm was reported
to be comparable to the thickness of DMPC bilayers in the gel phase.

Structural dependence on temperature and hydration has been studied by X-ray diffraction.
The equilibrium out-of-plane structure of the DMPC ripple phase has been 
reported to be only weakly dependent on temperature \cite{ref:Sengupta03}. 
In contrast, the ripple phase composed of 
\acs{POPC} showed a temperature dependent structure \cite{ref:Sengupta03}.
Hydration was shown to influence the monoclinic 
lattice constants \cite{ref:Wack89}. In multilamellar systems, the hydration
level is indicated by the $D$-spacing, and 
$\lambda_r$ and $\gamma$ were reported to generally decrease as $D$ increased
\cite{ref:Wack89}.
Knowledge of $\lambda_r$, $\gamma$, $A$, and $\xM$ as a function of hydration 
could elucidate how hydration affects the ripple sawtooth shape, but
there has been no reported systematic study of the ripple structural parameters 
such as $A$ and $\xM$ as a function of hydration.  

%\textcolor{red}{
%The ripple phase has also been observed in the top layer of 
%solid supported double bilayers through atomic force microscopy (AFM).
%Also Fragneto?
%The effect of the substrate on the top layer in the ripple phase has not been
%thoroughly studied. 
%It is not clear whether the structure of these ripple formation top layers
%is the same as that in a bulk sample such as MLVs and oriented samples.}

While the coarse grained electron density map of the asymmetric ripple has been well documented,
the molecular organization within the bilayers has been elusive.
In \cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03}, based on electron density profiles 
and model parameters obtained by phasing reflections from oriented samples
with the modeling and fitting technique, 
the authors suggested that chains in both major and minor arms are tilted
by the same angle with respect to the stacking $z$ direction and that 
chains are nearly parallel to the local normal in the major arm. 
This is inconsistent with the findings in \cite{ref:Sun96} that
the major arm thickness is almost identical to that of the gel phase where chains 
are tilted by $\sim$30\textdegree. To explain this discrepancy, 
they speculated that chains might be tilted by some amount into the 
direction perpendicular to the ripple direction. 


A structural investigation by X-ray diffraction of the ripple phase of
oriented dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (\acs{DPPC}) samples indicated that
hydrocarbon chains are packed in a hexagonal lattice with chains
tilted in the plane perpendicular to the ripple wavevector $\mathbf{a_2}$ \cite{ref:Hentschel91}.
In that study, $\gamma$ was found to be 90\textdegree.
It is believed that the resolved structure was for the symmetric ripple,
which has been shown to be thermodynamically metastable and whose occurrence
depends on the sample history \cite{ref:Katsaras00}. 
In \cite{ref:Hentschel91}, only symmetric ripple was observed in the low angle
X-ray scattering, which seems contradictory to the metastability of the
symmetric ripple \cite{ref:Katsaras00}.

Several works have suggested that the molecular conformation in the ripple phase 
consists of two distinct molecular conformations. 
NMR signals in the ripple phase were consistent
with a superposition of signals observed in the fluid and gel phases
\cite{ref:Wittebort81}.
Lateral diffusion measurements found two distinct rates,
with diffusion coefficients characteristic of fluid and gel phases
\cite{ref:Schneider83}. 
From these studies, the idea of micro phase separation that the major arm
is gel like while the minor arm is fluid like was proposed.
This idea is consistent with the later analysis \cite{ref:Sun96} 
of the low angle X-ray scattering 
data from an unoriented DMPC sample \cite{ref:Wack89}, which revealed that 
the major arm is thicker than the minor arm, and 
the major arm thickness is comparable to the thickness of the DMPC gel phase
\cite{ref:Sun96}.
This work was then followed by a wide angle X-ray study on
unoriented samples, arguing that the micro phase separation is consistent 
with the wide angle data \cite{ref:Cunningham98}.

A few MD (molecular dynamics) simulations have shed light on molecular 
organization in the ripple phase as well. 
de Vries \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:deVries05}
carried out atomistic simulations of DPPC resulting in an
asymmetric ripple where chains are all-trans in the major arm but
interdigitated in the minor arm. Chains in different leaflets
were reported to be decoupled, the chain tilt was modulated 
along the ripple direction.
Coarse-grain simulations performed later essentially reported the same results
\cite{ref:Lenz07}.
%\textcolor{red}{Despite many evidences from experiments and simulations, 
%the coexistence of different types of molecular packing in the major and minor arms 
%has not yet become widely accepted.}

Many theoretical papers have been published, attempting to understand
the origin of the ripple phase.
A theory developed by Chen \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Chen95} has been 
successful in describing some features in the ripple phase. In this theory,
the divergence of the lipid tilt field is coupled to the curvature 
of the bilayer. Increase in the divergence of the lipid tilt field is compensated 
by an increase in the curvature, leading to the observed height modulated
ripple phase. This theory predicted ripple phases with different symmetry
for chiral and achiral lipids. Later, Katsaras and Raghunathan 
\cite{ref:Katsaras95} carried out low angle X-ray scattering experiments
on regular DMPC and achiral DMPC and found no structural difference. 
More recently, Kamal \textit{et al.} have developed a Landau-Ginzburg theory
that includes a coupling of the tilt field to the chain conformation field
\cite{ref:Kamal11}.
From their theory, fluid like chain packing was predicted in the minor
arm and tilted, gel like chain packing in the major arm.

\subsection{Purpose of This Study}
Previous predictions and suggestions for molecular packing in the asymmetric
ripple so far have not been directly tested because of a lack of 
high resolution wide angle scattering data from an oriented sample.
Therefore, we sought to fill the gap
with synchrotron X-ray techniques. Our strengths were three fold: 1) brilliant
synchrotron beam that allowed use of Si monochromater with a very small
energy dispersion, 2) stacks of $\sim$2000 bilayers oriented on the substrate
that scattered strongly and anisotropically, and 3) hydration chamber that 
allowed us to control the hydration of the sample with minimum background scattering.

The symmetric ripple phase has only reflection symmetry and not centrosymmetry, 
so the phase factors are complex, making structure determination much more difficult 
than for the asymmetric ripple phase which does have centrosymmetry which restricts 
the phase factors to $\pm$1. We therefore focus on the asymmetric ripple phase.  
We also focus on DMPC over DPPC because it is experimentally difficult to avoid 
coexistence of the symmetric ripple phase with the asymmetric ripple phase
\cite{ref:Katsaras00}.
We chose DMPC over DLPC because the ripple phase exists in DLPC
for $T<0$~\textcelsius, which would make our experiments difficult.

The intial purpose of this study was to obtain better data relevant
to the packing of the lipids within the sawtooth, asymmetric ripple profile 
that has been well documented \cite{ref:Sun96,ref:Sengupta03}.
Chains in the major arm are believed to be packed similarly to the gel $L_{\beta'}$ phase,
where chains are stretched out in the all-trans conformation. 
In contrast, chains in the minor arm have been suggested to be disordered
like the fluid $L_\alpha$ phase \cite{ref:Wittebort81,ref:Schneider83,ref:Cunningham98,ref:Riske09}, 
or interdigitated like in the \LI\ phase \cite{ref:deVries05,ref:Lenz07}. 
Structure at small length scales requires WAXS.  
Previously published data \cite{ref:Katsaras95} suffer from loss 
of in-plane scattering intensity that we are able to obtain by using a wide 
angle scattering method, called  transmission WAXS (\acs{tWAXS}), where the x-rays 
go through the substrate before scattering from the sample.  As it was 
necessary to confirm the usual low angle structural parameters for our 
samples, we also obtained LAXS data. Remarkably, we observed 52 well 
separated reflections, many more than the 17 reported reflections 
in the Wack and Webb data from unoriented samples
\cite{ref:Wack89} or the 23 reflections obtained by Sengpupta \textit{et al.}
from oriented samples \cite{ref:Sengupta99}.  
These remarkable data are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:ripple_laxs_images}, and 
motivated an additional project to obtain a high resolution electron density map, 
improving upon the previous low resolution electron density map \cite{ref:Sun96}.

The extraction of bilayer form factors required to obtain electron density 
profiles is rather more demanding for oriented samples than for unoriented 
samples; this is documented in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_data_reduction} 
and \ref{sec:LAXS_form_factors} after describing the samples 
and the X-ray setup in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_MMs}.  
Obtaining the phases is also more 
challenging as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_models} before giving final results in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_edp}.  
The high resolution near grazing incidence WAXS (\acs{nGIWAXS}) results are presented 
in Sec.~\ref{sec:nGIWAXS_results},
and the low resolution tWAXS results in Sec.~\ref{sec:tWAXS_results}.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:thin_rod_model}, a model for the ripple phase WAXS pattern 
is developed.
Structural results obtained in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_edp} are combined with the model 
developed in Sec.~\ref{sec:thin_rod_model} to interpret the nGIWAXS and tWAXS data
in Sec.~\ref{sec:waxs_results}. 
Sec.~\ref{sec:waxs_results} discusses our results and compares them to previous work.
We conclude this chapter in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_conclusion}.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec:ripple_MMs}
\subsection{Sample Preparation}\label{sec:ripple_sample_prep}
DMPC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.
Four mg DMPC lyophilized powder was dissolved in 140 $\mu$L
chloroform:methanol (2:1 v:v) 
mixture. The solution was plated onto silicon wafers following the rock and
roll procedure \cite{Tristram-Nagle07_MMB}
(see also Sec.~\ref{sec:volume_method} for more details).
For all the ripple phase experiments, the temperature of the hydration 
chamber was maintained at 18 \textcelsius. 
In 2011 and 2012 synchrotron experiments, the samples were created and annealed 
for about six hours more than a week in advance and stored in an evacuated
dessicator in a refrigerator. The sample quality 
was found to worsen over time
after the samples were annealed. Therefore, to improve sample quality, 
in 2013 the 
samples were annealed for about 12 hours immediately prior to the X-ray experiment.
Figure~\ref{fig:annealing_chamber} shows a picture of the annealing chamber.
Annealing is promoted both by hydration and by elevated temperature. 
To achieve gentle but efficient hydration of a sample, filter papers were installed
that exposed a larger surface for evaporation. The temperature was set to
60 \textcelsius.
It must be emphasized that the annealing 
chamber should equilibrate in an annealing oven set to 60 \textcelsius,
prior to putting a sample in the chamber.
When a sample was placed in a room temperature chamber and
then the system was placed inside the oven, warmer water vapor inside the chamber 
condensed on the cooler sample, causing so-called flooding of the oriented sample. 
A small drop of water on an oriented film is detrimental for the orientation quality because the
entropy-driven formation of ULVs causes oriented bilayers to 
peel off one by one and disorient.

The sample for nGIWAXS was prepared in the same way 
as for the low angle study. In order to minimize the geometric broadening, the 
sample was trimmed to 1 mm in width along the beam direction.

The sample for the tWAXS study was deposited on a thin, 35 $\mu$m thick silicon
wafer and oriented following the rock and roll procedure \cite{Tristram-Nagle07_MMB}.  
Because the wafer was very fragile, 
the sample was attached to a plastic cap on 
a vial with a small amount of heat sink compound at a corner of the 
wafer. The wafer was stable enough for rocking.

\subsection{Instrumental Resolution}\label{sec:instrumental_resolution}
The X-ray scattering experiments were carried out at the Cornell 
High Energy Synchrotron Source (\acs{CHESS}) G1 station in three different runs
(2011, 2012, and 2013). 
The low angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) data analyzed 
in this thesis were collected in 2013.
The near grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (nGIWAXS) data
for the ripple phase were also collected
in the 2013 run, but with smaller energy dispersion than in the LAXS experiment.
The transmission wide angle X-ray scattering (tWAXS) data were collected
in the 2011 run. The nGIWAXS data for the fluid phase were also collected in
the 2011 run.
The ripple phase data in the 2012 run were not used
due to low sample quality.
The instrumental resolution in these X-ray experiments depended on the beam
divergence, energy dispersion, and geometric broadening 
as describe in the following subsections.

\subsubsection{Divergence}\label{sec:divergence}
The beam divergence quantifies an angular spread of the incoming X-ray
beam. We estimated the beam divergence by measuring the horizontal and 
vertical beam widths at two known sample-to-detector $S$ distances
with difference $\Delta S$. 
The beam widths were larger at the further distance, which indicated 
that the beam was divergent. 
We calculated the divergence as div = $\Delta B/\Delta S$, where
$\Delta B$ is the difference in beam widths or heights 
at different $S$ distances.
Table~\ref{tab:beam_divergence} summarizes beam divergence.

\subsubsection{Energy Dispersion}\label{sec:energy_dispersion}
A W/B$_4$C multilayer monochromater with energy bandwidth $\Delta E$/$E$ of
$\sim$1.3\% was used in the LAXS and tWAXS experiments. 
The energy of the X-ray beam was 10.55 keV, corresponding to an X-ray wavelength 
\gls{lambda} of 1.175 \AA, in the LAXS experiment.
To achieve a higher instrumental resolution, 
a (111) channel cut silicon monochromator was used for 
the nGIWAXS experiment, which gave $\Delta E/E$ of 0.01\%.
Due to the geometry of the G1 station, the Si monochromator was placed in
the G1 hutch, in series with the multilayer monochromator. 
Table~\ref{tab:energy_dispersion} summarizes energy dispersion.

\subsubsection{Geometric Broadening}\label{sec:geometric_broadening}
The finite size beam footprint on the sample causes
geometric broadening of diffraction peaks on the CCD detector.

\paragraph{LAXS}
In the LAXS experiment, 
the geometric broadening in the horizontal $x$ direction 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:LAXS_broadening}) is simply the 
horizontal beam width for $k=0$ peaks with minor additional broadening
for $k\neq 0$ peaks. Geometric broadening in the vertical $z$ direction
is due to different heights of the sample along the $y$ direction of the beam 
at non zero angle of incidence $\omega$. It is 
approximately
$w_s\tan\theta$, where \gls{ws} is the sample width along the $y$
direction and \gls{theta} is the scattering angle.
The beam shape, measured through a semi-transparent 200 $\mu$m thick
molybdenum (Mo) beam stop, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_lr_beamx}
and \ref{fig:ripple_lr_beamz}.
The horizontal beam width was 1.7 pixels (0.12 mm). The vertical beam
height was approximately 1 mm, tall enough to cover the entire sample
if the sample was tilted between 0\textdegree\ and 11.5\textdegree. 
The sample was rocked
during X-ray exposure between -1.6\textdegree\ and 7\textdegree\ 
in order to observe many diffraction peaks in one data collection.

  sample to detector distance of 359.7 mm. 
  The beam FWHM = 1.7 pixels, giving $\Delta\theta = 0.010$\textdegree\ or
  $\Delta q= 0.0019$ \AA$^{-1}$.}

  \label{fig:ripple_lr_beamz}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{nGIWAXS}
In near grazing incidence WAXS, 
the horizontal geometric broadening was due to the
sample width along the beam direction and the horizontal beam width.
From the geometry of the experiment shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:geometric_broadening}, 
the geometric broadening $\Delta x$ can be estimated,
assuming simple additivity,
\[
\Delta x = \Delta x_\textrm{beam} + w_\textrm{s}\tan(2\theta),
\] 
where $\theta$ is the in-plane scattering angle.
The total scattering angle $2\theta$ for the ripple WAXS was approximately 
16\textdegree. 
To minimize the contribution to $\Delta x$ from the sample, 
the sample was trimmed to $w_s$ = 1 mm along the beam direction. 
This width was chosen because (1) I could not trim more
without a more sophisticated device than a simple razor blade, (2) a 
narrower sample would scatter less X-rays, and (3) the disordering effect from 
the sample edge might become too significant to ignore. 
The horizontal beam width was 3.7 pixels (0.26 mm) as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS_beamx}.
With these experimental parameters, 
the resolution was estimated to be $\Delta x = 0.57$ mm = 8 pixels, 
which would be the unresolved width of an intrinsically infinitely sharp 
wide angle peak.
Indeed, the measured width of the (2, 0) Bragg peak in the gel \LbetaI\ phase
was 8 pixels as will be shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_phase}.
The sample-to-detector distance was 220.6 mm, measured using silver behenate.
Then, the minimum peak width measured in $q$-space would be
$\Delta q \approx 0.014$ \AA$^{-1}$. The vertical geometric broadening 
was negligible because the sample width $w_s$ was narrow and scattering
of interest occurred at small $q_z$.

\paragraph{tWAXS}
In transmission WAXS, 
geometric broadening in both $x$ and $z$ directions was non-negligible.
To calculate the broadening, let us assume that the beam has a rectangular
cross section with its height $Y_b$ and width $X_b$ as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:gb_trans1}. When the sample is tilted by $\omega$, X-rays emerging 
from the top edge of the sample travel a longer distance to the detector
compared to the X-rays from the bottom edge of the sample. 
This leads to 
distortion of the scattered beam; namely, the scattered beam will appear on 
the CCD screen as a parallelogram as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:gb_trans1}. 
Figure \ref{fig:gb_trans2} shows the top- and 
side view of the 
projection of the beam on the sample. From simple geometry, it can be shown 
that $a=Y_b/\tan\omega$, $b=aX/(2S)$, $c=aZ/(2S)+Y_b/2$, and $B=\tan^{-1}(Z/S)$. 
Since $H=2c$ and $W=2b$, $H$ and $W$ in Figure~\ref{fig:gb_trans3} are 
given by
\begin{align}
	H &= Y_b\left(1+\frac{Z}{S\tan\omega}\right)\\
	W &= Y_b\frac{X}{S\tan\omega}.
\end{align}
The sample to detector distance $S$ was 158.6 mm, giving an angular
CCD resolution of 0.013\textdegree/pixel, 
or 0.0024 \AA$^{-1}$/pixel.
The observed wide angle peak was at $(X,Z)$=(44.0 mm, 15.5 mm). 
The beam width and height were both 0.2 mm = 2.8 pixels.
With this setup, $W$ = 0.7 pixels and $H$ = 3.1 pixels. 
Therefore, the distorted shape of the diffraction peak was negligible.
Table~\ref{tab:geometric_broadening} summarizes geometric broadening for
our experiments.

\subsection{Low Angle X-ray Scattering (LAXS)}\label{sec:LAXS_method}
The X-ray beam for the low angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) experiment 
was set up by the station scientist, Dr. Arthor Woll.
We chose the sample to detector distance to be 359.7 mm, measured by indexing
silver behenate Bragg peaks. The D-spacing of silver behenate is known to be
58.367 \AA.

Occasionally, sheets of molybdenum (Mo), each nominally 25 $\mu$m 
thick were 
used to attenuate the incoming beam. 
These sheets had been installed in the G1 hutch by Dr. Woll upstream of our 
sample chamber.
The attenuation length \gls{mu} of 10.55 keV X-ray in Mo is 13.74 $\mu$m \cite{ref:cxro}.
%8 keV X-ray in Mo is 6.433 $\mu$m
For a 25 $\mu$m thick Mo attenuator, the attenuation factor is calculated to be
$[\exp(-25/13.74)]^{-1} = 6.2$. The exact attenuation factor was determined
by comparing X-ray images collected with and without the attenuator, 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:olddopc}.
The attenuation factor of the nominally 25 $\mu$m thick Mo was found to 
be 6.9 for the wavelength used (1.175 \AA), indicating an actual thickness
of ~27 $\mu$m.

  {(top panels) CCD images of X-ray scattering taken with (left) and without 
  (right) a nominally 25 $\mu$m thick Mo attenuator. These data were taken 
  at a fixed angle of incidence $\omega=0.8$\textdegree. The sample was an oriented film of 
  DOPC:DOPE (3:1) in the fluid phase at 37 \textcelsius. The wavelength
  was 1.175 \AA, the same as the one used for the ripple phase experiment.
  The same gray scale is used in both images. 100 pixel =  0.11 \AA$^{-1}$ in $q$. 
  A small dot located about $(p_x,p_z)=(520,170)$ between the first and second orders is

  The scattering intensity measured with the attenuator (red solid circles) 
  was multiplied by a factor of 6.9 and compared to the intensity measured 
  without the attenuator (black solid circles, right).}
  \label{fig:olddopc}
\end{figure}

Sheets of Mo were also used as a semi-transparent beam stop downstream of the 
sample, just 
outside the hydration chamber, to attenuate the beam and strong orders.
To avoid saturation of CCD pixels by
the very intense beam of $\sim$10$^{11}$ photons/mm$^2$/second, 200 or 225 $\mu$m 
were used depending on the exposure time.  Also, for long exposures 100 or 200 
$\mu$m were used to attenuate strong lower orders.  The longest exposure times 
were typically 60 or 120 seconds (doubled for dezingering), varying somewhat for 
different runs.

A few Bragg peaks in the LAXS of the ripple phase
were very strong, leading to saturation of CCD pixels for data collection
with a long exposure time. 
In order to probe a wide range of $q$-space, three images were taken:
1) a short, one second exposure with a nominally 25 $\mu$m
Mo attenuator installed upstream of the sample to reduce the 
intensity
of the incoming X-ray beam so that the intense (1, 0)
reflection did not 
saturate the CCD, 2) one second exposure without the beam attenuator,
and 3) 60 second exposure with a 100 $\mu$m Mo strip attenuating the very 
intense 
(1, 0) and (2, 0) peaks. 
The latter two exposures are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_laxs_images}. 
Then, the integrated intensity of the (1, 0) 
reflection was measured
from the first image. This value was multiplied by 6.9 to account for the beam
attenuation and then multiplied again by 60 to scale with intensities obtained 
at the longest exposure time. 
The intensities of (2, 0) and 
(2, -1) were measured from the second image, also
multiplied by 60 to account for the shorter exposure time. The intensities of
the rest of the observed peaks were measured from the third image.

The integrated intensity of each peak was obtained using the Nagle lab tview
software developed by Dr. Yufeng Liu \cite{Liu03} by defining a box around a
peak and summing the intensity in the pixels that fall inside the box.
The background scattering was estimated by measuring the intensity in pixels
near the peak but not containing any peak tail. The choice of box size was 
made according to the width of each peak. Because of mosaic spread in the sample,
the peaks were wider for higher orders. 
Consequently, the box was made wider for higher
orders. The box size was chosen so that approximately 80\% of the peak intensity
was counted toward the integrated intensity.

\subsection{Near Grazing Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering\\ (nGIWAXS)}\label{sec:nGIWAXS_method}
The high resolution wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
experiment was also carried out at the G1 station. 
A channel cut silicon monochromator was set up by the G1
station scientist, Dr. Arthur Woll, and the assistant scientist, Dr. Robin Baur.
WAXS was collected at an incident angle $\omega=$ 
0.2\textdegree. 
The total external reflection from an air-lipid interface occurs approximately 
at 0.1\textdegree\ and 0.17\textdegree\ for air-silicon interface, 
so 0.2\textdegree\ is not quite grazing incidence.
Grazing incidence usually implies that the incident angle is less than the 
critical angle for total external reflection.
Therefore, 0.2\textdegree\ is called near grazing incidence (nGI) in this thesis.
The background scattering was collected at $\omega$ = -0.2\textdegree. Subtraction
of the negative angle data from the positive angle data resulted in 
a sample scattering image as will be shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:waxs_data_reduction}.

%S1L = 153.6 mm, S1H = 220.6 mm, and S2 = 359.7 mm

\subsection{Transmission Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (tWAXS)}\label{sec:tWAXS_method}
These experiments were also carried out at the G1 station.
The incident angle $\omega$ was set to -45\textdegree\ for transmission data
collection (see Fig.~\ref{fig:holder_schematic}). 
A 35 $\mu$m thick silicon substrate attenuates 10.5 keV X-rays 
by only 20\%\ \cite{ref:cxro}, so most of the incoming X-rays penetrated
the thin substrate and none of the forward scattered X-rays were absorbed by the 
substrate.  This is a distinct advantage of tWAXS compared to nGIWAXS because 
reflections with small values of $q_z$ are not attenuated compared to those 
with large values of $q_z$.
 
The sample holder for tWAXS is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:holder_picture} and a 
schematic is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:holder_schematic}.  Unfortunately, it was not 
possible to design this sample holder so that the axis of rotation of the 
motor in the sample chamber coincided with the sample as it does for LAXS and 
nGIWAXS experiments.  This meant that the sample to detector distance varied 
as $\omega$ was varied. To accurately
measure the sample to detector distance, low angle scattering from a 
silver behenate (AgBe) sample was collected
at fixed $\omega$. Due to large mosaic spread of the AgBe sample, many orders were
visible. 
To measure the D-spacing of the sample, $\omega$ was set to 1\textdegree.
The sample to detector distance was measured to be 174.7 mm 
at $\omega$ = 0\textdegree.
From the sample holder geometry shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgeometry},
the sample to detector distance was estimated to be 
158.6 mm at $\omega=45$\textdegree.

To level the sample, 
the sample was first leveled coarsely by watching the sample scattering. When
$\omega$ was negative, much of the incoming beam was absorbed by the 
flat substrate, yielding weak sample scattering. When $\omega$ became 
positive, sample scattering was strong. With this procedure, 
we leveled the sample with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$\textdegree. We
then measured the beam intensity at various sample heights 
as a function of $\omega$. 
The sample was 
level when the beam intensity had the narrowest dip as the sample
was moved vertically through the beam.

Background scattering was collected by replacing the sample with a bare 
Si wafer. The bare Si wafer was not placed 
exactly at the same location
as the sample, which gave slightly different background scattering.
This only affected the background subtraction near the beam. 
The wide angle scattering was not affected by
this inexact placement of the bare wafer.

\subsection{Sample $q$-space}\label{sec:sample_q-space}
The incoming and outgoing wavevectors of the X-ray beam in Fig.~\ref{fig:laxs_setup}
are given by
\begin{equation}
  \gls{kin} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \yhat, \quad
  \gls{kout} = 
    \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \left( 
      \sin 2\theta \cos\phi \, \xhat
      + \cos 2\theta \, \yhat
      + \sin 2\theta \sin\phi \, \zhat 
    \right),
  %\label{eq:kinkout}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the X-ray wavelength, $2\theta$ is the total scattering
angle, and \gls{phi} is the angle measured from the equator on the detector. 
The scattering vector (also called
momentum transfer vector) is
the difference between $\kout$ and $\kin$,
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{q} &= \kout - \kin \nonumber \\
             &= q \left( 
                  \cos\theta\cos\phi \, \xhat - \sin\theta \, \yhat
                  + \cos\theta\sin\phi \, \zhat
                \right),
  \label{eq:q_vector}
\end{align}
where $q=4\pi\sin\theta/\lambda$ is the magnitude of the scattering vector. 
When the sample is rotated by $\omega$ about the lab x-axis in the clockwise 
direction as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:laxs_setup}, the sample $q$-space also 
rotates and 
is given by  
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\hat{e}_x} = \xhat, \quad
  \mathbf{\hat{e}_y} = \cos\omega\,\yhat + \sin\omega\,\zhat, \quad
  \mathbf{\hat{e}_z} = -\sin\omega\,\yhat + \cos\omega\,\zhat.
  \label{eq:smp_coord}
\end{equation}
From Eq.~(\ref{eq:q_vector}) and (\ref{eq:smp_coord}), we find Cartesian
components of the sample $q$-space to be
\begin{align}
  \gls{qx} &= \mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}_x} 
       = q\cos\theta\cos\phi, 
       \nonumber\\
  \gls{qy} &= \mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}_y} 
       = q\left(-\sin\theta\cos\omega + \cos\theta\sin\phi\sin\omega\right), 
       \nonumber\\
  \gls{qz} &= \mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}_z} 
       = q\left(\sin\theta\sin\omega + \cos\theta\sin\phi\cos\omega\right).
       \label{eq:qxqyqz}
\end{align}
The position, $(X,Z)$, of a CCD pixel is measured with respect to the beam 
and given by
\begin{equation}
  X = S \tan 2\theta \cos\phi, \quad Z = S \tan 2\theta \sin\phi,
  \label{eq:XZ}
\end{equation} 
where $S$ is the distance between the sample and detector.
From a model for the electron density of a lipid bilayer, one calculates
the X-ray scattering intensity pattern, $I(\mathbf{q})$. Then, Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz})
and (\ref{eq:XZ}) relate $I(\mathbf{q})$ to the experimentally measured
intensity pattern, $I(X,Z)$. 

For low angle x-ray scattering (LAXS), 
it is convenient to linearize Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz})
in terms of $\theta$ and $\omega$. In the small angle approximation, 
$\sin\phi \approx Z/(2S\theta)$ and $\cos\phi \approx X/(2S\theta)$, and
\begin{align}
  q_x &\approx \frac{4\pi\theta\cos\phi}{\lambda} \approx kX/S \nonumber\\
  q_y &\approx q_z\omega -\frac{4\pi\theta^2}{\lambda} \approx q_z\omega - \frac{\lambda q_z^2}{4\pi}\nonumber\\
  q_z &\approx \frac{4\pi\theta\sin\phi}{\lambda} \approx kZ/S,
  \label{eq:qxqyqz_small}
\end{align}
with $k=2\pi/\lambda$. For wide angle X-ray scattering, the exact relations given
by Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz}) are necessary. Especially in the transmission experiment,
where $\omega$ is large, an observed X-ray pattern appears nontrivial, and 
quantitative analysis requires Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz}).
The transmission experiment is discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:tWAXS_results}.

\section{LAXS Data Reduction}\label{sec:LAXS_data_reduction}
The lattice structure of a stack of bilayers in the ripple  phase is a two 
dimensional monoclinic lattice. 
In an oriented sample, the stacking $z$ direction and the ripple
$x$ direction are separated, rendering peak indexing a trivial task as 
shown in the next subsection.
However, obtaining the form factors from measured intensity is considerably
more involved and requires the development of the three correction factors 
described in the following three subsections.

\subsection{Lattice Structure -- Unit Cell}\label{sec:lattice_structure}
The unit cell vectors for the two-dimensional oblique lattice shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:unit_cell}
can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{a_1} = \frac{D}{\tan\gamma}\xhat + D\zhat
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{a_2} = \lambda_r\xhat.
\end{equation}
The corresponding reciprocal lattice unit cell vectors are
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{A_1} = \frac{2\pi}{D}\zhat
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{A_2} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_r}\xhat - \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_r\tan\gamma}\zhat.
\end{equation}
The reciprocal lattice vector, $\mathbf{q}_{hk}$ for the Bragg peak with 
Miller indices \gls{hk} is 
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{q}_{hk}=h\mathbf{A_1}+k\mathbf{A_2},
\end{equation}
so its Cartesian components are
\begin{align}
  & \mathbf{q}_{hk}\cdot\xhat = q_{hk}^x = \frac{2\pi k}{\lambda_r}\\
  & \mathbf{q}_{hk}\cdot\yhat = q_{hk}^y = 0 \\
  & \mathbf{q}_{hk}\cdot\zhat = \gls{qhkz} = \frac{2\pi h}{D} - \frac{2\pi k}{\lambda_r\tan\gamma}.
\end{align}
Our sample consists of many ripple domains with a uniform distribution of 
in-plane directions of the
ripple wavevector, $\mathbf{a_2}$ 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:unit_cell}. 
This means that, for any $(h,k)$ reflection, there is always a domain that has 
an in-plane orientation such that quasi-elastic scattering occurs and a peak 
is observed on the CCD.  
In this case, $q_{hk}^x$ and $q_{hk}^y$ may be combined to 
give \gls{qhkr} = $2\pi k/\lambda_r$.  
Fig.~3.2 shows this Miller index pattern from which the in-plane ripple repeat 
distance $\lambda_r$ = 145.0 \AA, the out-of-plane repeat distance 
$D$ = 57.8 \AA, and the oblique angle $\gamma$ = 98.2\textdegree\ for that 
sample were easily obtained.
Values of $q_{hk}^r$ and $\qz{hk}$ for observed reflections are included
in Tables~\ref{tab:obs_intensity1} and \ref{tab:obs_intensity2}.

The ripple wavelength $\lambda_r$ and oblique angle $\gamma$ of the DMPC
ripple phase depend on hydration level \cite{ref:Wack89} 
(see Table~\ref{tab:wack_lattice}).
The best LAXS data from an unoriented sample were reported for $D$ = 57.9~\AA\ 
at $T$ = 18~\textcelsius. In this thesis, 
to compare LAXS data from an oriented sample to the data from 
an unoriented sample,
we studied the ripple phase LAXS at the same temperature $T$ = 18 \textcelsius\ 
and very similar hydration level $D$ = 57.8 \AA.
The lattice constants for the data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_laxs_images} are 
included in Table~\ref{tab:wack_lattice}.
The bilayer structure in the ripple phase has been shown to be independent 
of temperature \cite{ref:Sengupta03}, so the findings in this thesis are
applicable to the DMPC ripple phase at other temperature.

\subsection{Lorentz Correction}\label{sec:Lorentz_correction}
Our sample has in-plane rotational symmetry about the $z$-axis. 
Ignoring mosaic spread to which we will come back later, this means that the sample 
consists of many domains with differing ripple directions, all domains
being parallel to the substrate.  
In sample $q$-space, ripple ($h, k\neq 0$) side peaks are represented as rings 
centered at the meridian, or $q_z$-axis, 
while ($h, k=0$) main peaks are still points on the meridian 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_sample_qspace}). 
Then, for an arbitrary incident angle $\omega$, $(h, 0)$ peaks are not observed
while side peaks are observed for a range of $\omega$ as will now be explained. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption[Ewald sphere construction to obtain relation between location of 
  scattering peaks on the CCD and their $q$-space values]
  {Ewald sphere construction to obtain relation between location of 
  scattering peaks on the CCD and their $q$-space values. The incoming X-ray 
  wavevector is $\kin$, and $\kout$ is a scattered X-ray wavevector with 
  $|\kout|=|\kin|$ for the predominant quasi-elastic scattering. 
  A part of the $q$-space pattern is shown for the ripple phase in the low angle 
  regime. For $(h, k=0)$ Miller indices, there are points labelled $k=0$ on the 
  $q_z$ axis.  
  For $(h,k\neq0)$ there are rings labelled $k\neq0$ centered on the 
  $q_z$-axis. The red dashed line shows the portion of a ring that is inside 
  the Ewald sphere and the portion outside is shown as a black solid 
  or dashed line. 
  Diffraction occurs where the ring and the sphere intersect. For our wavelength

  $\qz{50}=0.54$ \AA$^{-1}$, one tenth of $|\kin|$.
  For clarity $|\mathbf{q}|$ is drawn large compared to $|\kin|$. 
  }
  \label{fig:ripple_sample_qspace}
\end{figure}

In order to capture all ($h, k$) peaks in one X-ray exposure, 
the sample was continuously rotated over a range of $\omega$, \gls{Deltaomega},
about the $x$-axis. As a result of this rotation, 
the $(h, 0)$ main peaks become arcs that subtend an angle $\Delta\omega$,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ewald_main}, with its lengths
equal to $\Delta\omega\qz{h0}$. 
The detector records the intersections of these arcs with the 
Ewald sphere \cite{ref:Warren69}, 
so the intrinsic scattering intensity of the $(h, 0)$ reflections
is the product of the observed intensity, $\Io{h0}$ with the arc length, that is, 
\begin{equation}
  I_{h0} = \Delta\omega\qz{h0} \Io{h0}. \label{eq:main_ewald}
\end{equation}
This gives the usual Lorentz correction for lamellar orders.

Now, we consider relative intensity of side peaks for a given order $h$.
As described earlier, $(h, k\neq 0)$ side peaks are represented as
rings whose radius is $\qr{hk}$ in the sample $q$-space. 
Because only the domains with the right ripple direction can satisfy Bragg's condition at a given fixed
angle $\omega$, the intrinsic scattering intensity in this ring is reduced by 
a factor of $2\pi \qr{k}$ compared to the $(h, 0)$ reflections.
This reduction of intensity can be nicely visualized by the Ewald sphere construction
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_sample_qspace},
which shows that the entire rings are not intersected by the Ewald sphere at 
a fixed angle. Then, the intrinsic scattering intensity in a ring is
\begin{equation}
  I_{hk\neq 0} \propto 2\pi \qr{hk} \Io{hk}. \label{eq:side_ewald}
\end{equation}
During an X-ray exposure, the sample $q$-space rotates and 
the rings are intersected by the Ewald sphere at all our experimental incident angles $\omega$.
However, as Fig.~\ref{fig:ewald_side} shows, only small parts of the rings
are actually intersected with the Ewald sphere.  
To obtain the full expression for $(h,k\neq 0)$ reflections, we now turn
to a more rigorous calculation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  for $h$ = 1 and 2 and $k$ = 0, 1, and 2 in $\qz{hk}$ planes.
  The intersection between the Ewald sphere and 
  a Bragg peak/ring is indicated in red. 
  The observed intensity for the $k\neq 0$ orders is proportional to
  the fraction of the length of red arcs to the circumference. This 
  fraction is equal to one for $k=0$ reflections.
  Because the reflections are not in the same $q_z$ plane, the range of $q_y$ 
  integration indicated by the height of the gray rectangle is different for different
  $h$ orders. For $\gamma\neq 90$\textdegree, the range of $q_y$ integration is
  slightly different for different $k$ reflections with the same $h$. 
  The values shown are for $D=58$~\AA, $\lambda_r=145$~\AA, $\gamma=90$\textdegree,
  and $\lambda=1.175$ \AA. For visibility, the height of the gray rectangles 
  is exaggerated by about a factor of 10, exaggerating the arc curvature.  
  With the shown large curvature, the peaks would have an asymmetric 
  shape in the $q_r$ direction.}
  \label{fig:ewald_side}
\end{figure}

Mathematically, the rotation is  
equivalent to an integration over $\omega$. In LAXS, 
$q_z$ is nearly constant at a given pixel as $\omega$ is varied, 
which can be seen from 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz_small}). As Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz_small}) shows, 
$\omega$ dependence appears only through $q_y$, 
so rotating the sample is realized by integrating over $q_y$;
formally, we write $d\omega=dq_y/q_z$.
To derive the integration limits on $q_y$, let us consider two cases: 
(1) When $\omega \leq 0$,
the incoming X-ray beam is blocked by the back of the substrate. This sets 
the lower limit of $\omega$ to 0. Plugging $\omega=0$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:qxqyqz_small}),
we find the lower limit of the $q_y$ integration to be $-\lambda q_z^2/(4\pi)$.
(2) When $\omega \geq 2\theta$, the substrate blocks 
the outgoing X-ray, so the maximum $\omega = 2\theta$. 
Within the small angle approximation, $q_z \approx 4\pi\theta/\lambda$. 
Then, the maximum $\omega$ can be expressed as $\lambda q_z/(2\pi)$.
Plugging this expression for $\omega$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:qxqyqz_small}),
we find the upper limit of the $q_y$ integration to be $\lambda q_z^2/(4\pi)$.
Also integrating over the detector pixels $X$ and $Z$ to obtain integrated intensity, 
we write the observed intensity as
\begin{align}
  \gls{Ihkobs} 
    &\propto \int dX \int dZ \int \mathop{d\omega} I_{hk} \nonumber \\
    &\propto \int dq_x \int dq_z 
             \int_{-\frac{\lambda q_z^2}{4\pi}}^{\frac{\lambda q_z^2}{4\pi}} 
             \frac{dq_y}{q_z} 
             I_{hk}(\mathbf{q}),
  \label{eq:I_obs_general}
\end{align}
where $1/q_z$ factor in $q_y$ integration is the usual Lorentz polarization factor
in the small angle approximation. 

For a crystalline sample with in-plane rotational symmetry, the
structure factor of a ripple Bragg peak is  
\begin{equation}
  S_{hk}(\mathbf{q}) = S_{hk}(q_r,q_z) 
  = \frac{1}{2\pi q_r}\delta(q_r-\qr{hk})\delta(q_z-\qz{hk}),
\end{equation} 
where $\qr{hk}=2\pi |k|/\lambda_r$. Thus, the scattering pattern in the 
ripple phase is a 
collection of Bragg rings for $k\neq 0$ centered at the meridian and the 
Bragg peaks for $k=0$ located along the meridian.  
The scattering intensity is $I(\mathbf{q})=|F(\mathbf{q})|^2S(\mathbf{q})$,
where $F(\mathbf{q})$ is the form factor. After the $q_z$ integration,
the observed, integrated intensity of $(h,k)$ peak is proportional to
\begin{equation}
  \Io{hk} 
    \propto \frac{\lvert \gls{Fhk} \rvert^2}{\qz{hk}} \int\mathop{dq_x} 
            \int_{-q_{hk}^{y0}}^{q_{hk}^{y0}}
            \mathop{dq_y} \frac{\delta(q_r-\qr{hk})}{2\pi q_r},
  \label{eq:obs_integration}
\end{equation}
where $q_{hk}^{y0} = \lambda (\qz{hk})^2/(4\pi)$.
For side peaks ($k \neq 0$), we have 
\begin{align}
  \int\mathop{dq_x} \int_{-q_{hk}^{y0}}^{q_{hk}^{y0}}\mathop{dq_y} \frac{\delta(q_r-\qr{hk})}{2\pi q_r}
  &\approx \int_{-q_{hk}^{y0}/\qr{hk}}^{q_{hk}^{y0}/\qr{hk}} \mathop{d\phi} 
          \int \mathop{dq_r} q_r\frac{\delta(q_r-\qr{hk})}{2\pi q_r} \nonumber\\
  &= \frac{q_{hk}^{y0}}{\pi \qr{hk}}. 
  \label{eq:side_integrand}
\end{align}
For main peaks ($k=0$), we have 
\begin{align}
  \int\mathop{dq_x} \int_{-q_{hk}^{y0}}^{q_{hk}^{y0}}\mathop{dq_y} \frac{\delta(q_r-\qr{hk})}{2\pi q_r}
  &= \int_0^{2\pi}\mathop{d\phi} \int\mathop{dq_r} q_r\frac{\delta(q_r-\qr{hk})}{2\pi q_r} \nonumber\\
  &= 1 
  \label{eq:main_integrand}
\end{align}
Using Eq.~(\ref{eq:obs_integration} -- \ref{eq:main_integrand}), 
we write the observed integrated intensity as
\begin{align}
  \Io{h0} &\propto \frac{|F_{h0}|^2}{\qz{h0}} \label{eq:main}\\
  \Io{hk} &\propto \frac{|F_{hk}|^2}{\qz{hk}} \frac{q_{hk}^{y0}}{\pi \qr{hk}}
    = |F_{hk}|^2 \frac{\lambda \qz{hk}}{2\pi}\frac{1}{2\pi \qr{hk}}
    = |F_{hk}|^2 \frac{2\theta_{hk}}{2\pi \qr{hk}}, \label{eq:side}
\end{align}
where $2\theta_{hk} = \lambda \qz{hk}/(2\pi)$ is the incident angle at which 
the outgoing X-ray for the peak $(h,k)$ is blocked by the substrate.
Eq.~(\ref{eq:main}) and (\ref{eq:side}) relate the form factor calculated from
a model to the experimentally observed intensity.

\subsection{Absorption Correction for LAXS}\label{sec:absorption_correction}
In this section, we derive the absorption correction for an oriented sample. 
The calculation involves an explicit integration over the incident angle, 
$\omega$, which is necessitated by the sample rotation during an X-ray exposure. 
The procedure is to write down an absorption factor, $A(\omega,\theta)$, for a 
given scattering angle 2$\theta$ at a given incident angle $\theta$, and
then integrate over $\omega$. We ignore $q_x$ dependence because the X-ray
path inside the sample is nearly within the $y$-$z$ plane for low angle
scattering. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/ripple/analysis/absorption_LAXS}
  \caption[The path of X-rays within the sample]
  {The path of X-rays within the sample. The incident angle is 
  $\omega$ and the total scattering angle is $2\theta$. An X-ray with a
  penetration depth of $z$ is shown. The total thickness of the sample
  is $t$. Refraction correction is negligible for 
  $\theta > 0.5$\textdegree ($h=1$).}
  \label{fig:absorption_LAXS}
\end{figure}

Assume that all the X-rays enter the sample from the top surface. The total scattering
angle is given by $2\theta$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:absorption_LAXS}).
Let the $z$-axis point downward. At the top surface
(air-sample interface), $z=0$. For X-rays that travel to $z$ and then scatter, the
total path length within the sample is 
\begin{equation}
  L(z,\omega,\theta) 
  = \frac{z}{\sin\omega}+\frac{z}{\sin(2\theta-\omega)} 
  = zg(\omega,\theta),
\end{equation}
where $g(\omega,\theta)=(\sin\omega)^{-1}+\bracks{\sin\pars{2\theta-\omega}}^{-1}$.
For each ray, the intensity is attenuated by the sample. 
Compared to the scattering intensity from $z=0$, the attenuated intensity is
\begin{equation}
  I(z,\omega,\theta) = I_0\exp\left(-\frac{L}{\mu}\right),
  \label{eq:ray}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the absorption length of an X-ray. $\mu$ is about 2.6 mm for 
10.5 keV X-ray
for both water and lipids in all phases \cite{ref:cxro}.
The observed sample scattering intensity at fixed $\omega$ 
is equal to the integration
of Eq.~(\ref{eq:ray}) over the total thickness of the sample and given by
\begin{align}
  I(\omega,\theta) 
    &= \int_0^t \dz I(z,\omega,\theta)
     = I_0\int_0^t\dz \exp\left(-\frac{g(\omega,\theta)}{\mu}z\right) \nonumber \\
    &= I_0\mu \frac{1-\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\mu}g(\omega,\theta)\right)}{g(\omega,\theta)}.
    \label{eq:I_obs1}
\end{align}
Defining the absorption factor at a fixed angle to be $A(\omega,\theta)$, 
the observed intensity can also be written as
\begin{equation}
  I(\omega,\theta)=A(\omega,\theta)tI_0,
  \label{eq:I_obs2}
\end{equation}
where $tI_0$ is the intensity we would observe for non-absorbed X-rays.
Equating Eq.~(\ref{eq:I_obs1}) and (\ref{eq:I_obs2}), we get
\begin{equation}
  A(\omega,\theta) = \frac{\mu}{t} 
                     \frac{1-\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\mu}g(\omega,\theta)\right)}{g(\omega,\theta)}.
  \label{eq:ang_abs_factor}
\end{equation}
If $\mu$ is taken to infinity (no absorption), $A(\omega,\theta)$ 
goes to 1 as expected.
The absorption factor $A_{h0}$ for the $k=0$ peaks is given by
$A(\omega=\theta=\theta_B)$, plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:abs_factor}.
As shown, this factor is about 20 \% for $h=1$ peak relative to
$h=4$, so it is not negligible.

  \label{fig:abs_integrand}
\end{figure}

For $k\neq 0$ side peaks, an integration over the incident angle $\omega$
is necessary because these peaks are observable at all our experimental incident angles as
described in section \ref{sec:Lorentz_correction}.
The observed intensity for side peaks from a rotating sample is simply
\begin{equation}
  I_\textrm{obs}(\theta) 
  = \int_0^{2\theta}\mathop{d\omega} I(\omega,\theta).
  \label{eq:total_obs_I}
\end{equation}
The upper integration limit is equal to $2\theta$ because the substrate
completely blocks the scattered X-rays above this angle as discussed in 
section \ref{sec:Lorentz_correction}. Eq.~(\ref{eq:ang_abs_factor}),
which is essentially the integrand in Eq.~(\ref{eq:total_obs_I}), is 
plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:abs_integrand}. It is maximum when $\omega=\theta$,
meaning that the path length is shortest at the Bragg condition.
The non-attenuated observed intensity is equal to $2\theta t I_0$. We
define the absorption factor \gls{Atheta} to be the ratio of the total 
observed intensity to the total non-attenuated intensity,
\begin{align}
  A(\theta) \equiv \frac{I_\textrm{obs}(\theta)}{2\theta tI_0}. 
  \label{eq:abs_factor_def}
\end{align}
Using Eq.~(\ref{eq:ang_abs_factor}) and (\ref{eq:total_obs_I})
in (\ref{eq:abs_factor_def}), we arrive
at the final absorption factor
\begin{equation}
  A(\theta) = \frac{1}{2\theta}\int_0^{2\theta}d\omega A(\omega,\theta)
  = \frac{\mu}{2\theta t} \int_0^{2\theta}d\omega 
  \frac{1-\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\mu}g(\omega,\theta)\right)}{g(\omega,\theta)}.
  \label{eq:abs_factor}
\end{equation}
$A_{hk} = A(\theta)$ is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:abs_factor}.
The absorption correction $A_c(\theta)$ is the inverse of Eq.~(\ref{eq:abs_factor}).

\subsection{Correction due to Mosaic Spread}\label{sec:mosaic_spread_correction}
Integrated intensity needs to be corrected for mosaic spread, which consists 
of a distribution of domains of bilayers misoriented with respect to the 
substrate. 
During an X-ray exposure, the sample
was continuously rotated. Due to this rotation, each pixel integrates 
intensity over a range of incident angles $\omega$.
As described in appendix~\ref{app:mosaic_exp}, 
a mosaic spread distribution can be probed
by changing $\omega$, so rotating the sample is essentially  
equivalent to integrating a mosaic spread distribution.
Because the range of the distribution probed is approximately given by 
$\omega=[0, 2\theta_{hk}]$ 
where $\theta_{hk}$ is the Bragg angle for a $(h,k)$ reflection, 
this range is larger for higher $h$ orders. 
This effect is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:mosaic_contour}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/ripple/analysis/mosaic_contour}
  \caption[Contours of a mosaic spread distribution projected on the $\omega\chi$-plane,
  where $\chi-\chi_{hk}$ is an angle measured from a $(h,k)$ reflection on the detector

  Bragg angle for the $(h,k)$ reflection]
  {Contours of a mosaic spread distribution projected on the $\omega\chi$-plane,
  where $\chi-\chi_{hk}$ is an angle measured from a $(h,k)$ reflection on the detector
  (\gls{chi} = $\pi/2-\phi$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:laxs_setup}) and $\theta_{hk}$ is the
  Bragg angle for the $(h,k)$ reflection.
  The distribution function is assumed to be a 2D Lorentzian centered at $\alpha=0$.
  Domains with $\alpha=0$ are probed at $\omega=\theta_{hk}$ and $\chi=\chi_{hk}$.
  Integrated intensity of $(1,k)$ reflections arise from domains in the green
  shaded area while that of $(3,k)$ reflections are from the
  blue shaded area, which is three times larger.}
  \label{fig:mosaic_contour} 
\end{figure}

We limit $\chi-\chi_{hk}$ to go from -1.4\textdegree\ to 1.4\textdegree\
by our choice of integration boxes for the intensity.  
The effect of the $\chi-\chi_{hk}$ cutoff is not very important
because most of observed intensity was included in the integration boxes.
In contrast, the cutoff on $\omega$ due to the
substrate blocking the scattering
is important, especially for lower $h$ orders.
 
We assume the mosaic distribution to be an azimuthally symmetric
2D Lorentzian, which has been observed 
experimentally in this laboratory (manuscript in preparation),
\begin{equation}
  P(\alpha) = \frac{N}{\alpha^2+\alpha_M^2},
  \label{eq:P_alpha}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is a normalization constant and $\alpha_M$ is the half width
half maximum of the distribution. $N$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
  N = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left(\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\mathop{d\alpha}
  \frac{\alpha}{\alpha^2+\alpha_M^2}\right)^{-1}.
  \label{eq:mosaic_N}
\end{equation}
For small $\alpha$, Eq.~\ref{eq:P_alpha} can be approximated in terms of 
Cartesian coordinates as
\begin{equation}
  P(\omega,\chi) \approx \frac{N}{\omega^2+\chi^2+\alpha_M^2}.
\end{equation}
We then consider a two dimensional contour map on the $\omega\chi$ plane,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mosaic_contour}.
Mosaic factor for a reflection with Bragg angle $\theta_B$ is
given by
\begin{equation}
  M = \int_{-\theta_B}^{\theta_B}\mathop{d\omega} 
  \int_{-\chi_0}^{\chi_0}\mathop{d\chi} P(\omega,\chi)
  = \int_{-\theta_B}^{\theta_B}\mathop{d\omega}
  \int_{-\chi_0}^{\chi_0}\mathop{d\chi}
  \frac{N}{\omega^2+\chi^2+\alpha_M^2}
  \label{eq:mosaic_I}
\end{equation}
After the integration over $\chi$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:mosaic_I}) is
\begin{equation}
  M = 4N\int_0^{\theta_B}\frac{d\omega}{\sqrt{\omega^2+\alpha_M^2}}
  \arctan\pars{\frac{\chi_0}{\sqrt{\omega^2+\alpha_M^2}}}.
  \label{eq:mosaic_I2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Synopsis of Intensity Corrections}
Tables~\ref{tab:LAXS_correction1} and \ref{tab:LAXS_correction2} show
the values of the corrections obtained from the analysis in the previous three 
subsections using properties of our samples. The absorption and mosaicity 
corrections are significant for the lowest orders and their product largely 
accounts for the smaller intensities previously noted 
\cite{ref:Guler09} for the lower orders of gel phase oriented 
samples compared to unoriented MLV samples which do not have these corrections.  
These two corrections decrease gradually as $h$ increases with small 
modulations with $k$. In contrast, the Lorentz correction varies strongly with 
both $h$ and $k$ although it is the same for the same $h/k$. The importance of 
the previous three sections is emphasized by the result that the largest 
correction for $(1,3)$ is a factor of 367 greater than for the smallest 
correction for $(1,0)$.

\section{Results for $|F_{hk}|$ Form Factors}\label{sec:LAXS_form_factors}
Tables~\ref{tab:obs_intensity1} and 
\ref{tab:obs_intensity2} list the observed 
$(h,k)$ reflections and their $q_z$ and $q_r$ values for our best sample shown 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:ripple_laxs_images}. The $q_z$ values 
for observed peaks were corrected for index of refraction (Appendix~\ref{app:refraction}).
Column $I^\text{obs}_{hk}$ is the sum of intensity observed within an
integration box centered on the peak with size shown in the box size column.  
These intensities were multiplied by the total correction factor redisplayed 
from Table \ref{tab:LAXS_correction1},
and the square root was taken to obtain 
unnormalized  $|F_{hk}|$.  
As there is an arbitrary scale factor in the data, the $|F_{hk}|$ shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:obs_intensity1} were then normalized to set $|F_{10}|$ = 100.

The \gls{sigmaI} column in table~\ref{tab:obs_intensity1} gives uncertainties on 
$I^\text{obs}_{hk}$.
The largest contribution to $\sigma_I$ for weak orders was the background 
scattering, which
was assumed to be a constant for each peak and 
estimated by plotting a swath along a given peak 
and seeing where the peak tail ended. This was done visually and repeating 
the process led to differences which determined the estimated $\sigma_I$.  
For some peaks, uncertainty mostly came 
from the mosaic arc of stronger nearby peaks. For example, the (4, -1) peak was a
strong order, but the mosaic arc of its nearby stronger (4, 0) peak  
overlapped with the (4, -1) peak, giving a relatively large uncertainty
on the (4, -1) peak. While most $k<0$ peaks were susceptible to
mosaic arc, $k > 0$ peaks were not. Therefore, though $k> 0$ peaks were weaker
compared to corresponding $k < 0$ peaks, their integrated intensity
had smaller $\sigma_I$. We assigned a large uncertainty on the (3, 1) peak because
it overlapped with the $q_z$ tail of the (3, -1) peak, making separation of 
(3, 1) and (3, -1) difficult. It was also not clear whether the (3, 1) peak
was extinct or not. $\sigma_I$ for this peak was estimated by placing a
box centered at the nominal position of this peak, and it is likely that a fraction
of the intensity assigned to (3, -1) in table~\ref{tab:obs_intensity1} belongs to (3, 1).
The (1, 1) and (1, -1) also overlapped in a similar manner, so their
relative $\sigma_I$ are larger than some of the well separated less intense peaks.  
Some peaks, such as (1, 2), (4, 3), (6, 2), (9, -1), (9, -3), and all the 
$(8,k)$ peaks were deemed to be extinct because neighboring peaks had 
observable intensity. As zero is also an observation, these orders were also 
included in the table.

To assign uncertainties to the absolute 
form factors $|F|=\sqrt{I}$ requires propagating $\sigma_I$ to \gls{sigmaF}.
To do this, we estimated the most likely upper bound on each measured intensity 
$I+\sigma_I$. The most likely upper bound for $|F|$ was determined by
$(|F|+\sigma_F)^2=I+\sigma_I$, which gives $\sigma_F$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:simga_F}
  \sigma_F=|F|\left(-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{\sigma_I}{|F|^2}}\right).
\end{equation}
In the small $\sigma_I/I$ regime, $\sigma_F=\sigma_I/(2|F|)$. In the 
large $\sigma_I/I$ regime, $\sigma_F=\sqrt{\sigma_I}$. For the lower limit,
a similar consideration gives the same uncertainty $\sigma_F=\sigma_I/(2|F|)$
for the small $\sigma_I/I$. The lower limit in the $\sigma_I/I$ regime
should be zero for the absolute form factors $|F|$. For the form factor $F$,
we take $\sigma_F$ given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:simga_F}) as an estimated 
uncertainty. For very weak peaks whose intensity could not be determined but
whose nearby peaks were observed, we assigned $|F|$ = 0 and 
$\sigma_F = \sqrt{\sigma_I}$ where $\sigma_I$ was estimated based on the
background scattering intensity at the $q$ value corresponding to those
unobserved weak peaks. 

Our best oriented sample in Fig.~3.2 had almost the same $D$, $\gamma$, and 
only slightly different ${\lambda}_r$ as the best data of Wack and Webb 
\cite{ref:Wack89} from an unoriented sample. 
Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack} compares our oriented 
$\left|\gls{Fhkori}\right|$ with the unoriented 
$\left|\gls{Fhkun}\right|$. The most obvious comparison is that there 
are very few unoriented orders, only 18 compared to 60 orders in tables 
\ref{tab:obs_intensity1} and \ref{tab:obs_intensity2}.
We could not determine the form factors for the $h=0$ orders for our
oriented sample because of strong attenuation of X-rays 
at $\omega \approx$ 0\textdegree.
As noted in Sun \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Sun96}, however,
inclusion of $h=0$ orders would not significantly alter the bilayer 
structure, so these orders were omitted in Table~\ref{tab:obs_intensity1}.
The $k=5$ and $k=6$ reflections shown in Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack} 
provide 
higher in-plane resolution in the oriented data, 
and the observability of the 
lamellar orders all the way to $h=9$ provides three times higher resolution 
along the $z$-axis.

As discussed extensively in the previous section, oriented samples require 
complex corrections, so 
comparison with the relatively 
straightforward Lorentz correction from an 
unoriented sample with similar structure allows us to check our corrections.  
Although the ratios of the normalized form factors vary from 0.62 to 1.38, 
there appears to be no sign that our corrections are flawed.  We propose a 
different reason why the ratios deviate so much from unity. In X-ray data from 
an oriented sample, most peaks were
well separated on the two-dimensional CCD, so integrating a peak intensity was 
usually straightforward.
In contrast, intensities from unoriented data are collapsed onto 
one-dimension and overlap much more, making separation of intensity 
difficult.  Three such pairs of overlapping peaks are highlighted in 
Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack}.  
We show a modified $\left|F_{hk}^\text{un}\right|$ in 
Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack} where we have shifted some intensity from 
the (1, 0) peak to the (1, -1) peak and some intensity from the (2, 0) peak 
to the (2, -1) peak.  
Although there is a remaining discrepancy for the (1, 1) reflection, 
the modified ratios are generally improved. Of course, even though it makes 
sense to compare these unoriented and oriented samples, one should not expect 
perfect agreement, especially as the ripple wavelength differs by 2.3\%.

\section{Models to Fit the $|F_{hk}|$ and Obtain the Phase Factors}\label{sec:LAXS_models}
In order to obtain electron density profiles, one requires the phase factors 
for the $|F_{hk}|$.  
Once the phases are obtained, an experimental electron density map 
$\rho(\mathbf{r})$ = \gls{rhoxz} is obtained
by using
\begin{equation}
  \rho(x,z) = \sum_{h,k} \Phi_{hk} \left|F_{hk}^\text{exp}\right| \cos(q_{hk}^xx+q_{hk}^zz),
  \label{eq:Fourier_reconstruction}
\end{equation}
where \gls{Phihk} is the phase factor.  
Fortunately, the ripple phase has a center of inversion symmetry, so 
$\Phi_{hk}$ is limited to be either $\pm 1$. Nevertheless, that still 
leaves $2^{60}$ possibilities for our oriented data.  
It was shown by Sun \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Sun96} that devising plausible 
models with structural parameters, such as those indicated in Fig. 3.1, and 
fitting those models to the observed $|F_{hk}|$ gave a robust set of phase 
factors for the low resolution data of Wack and Webb \cite{ref:Wack89}.  
That strategy will be followed here.

Following Ref.~\cite{ref:Sun96} the electron density model for $\rho(x,z)$ within 
the unit cell is described
as the convolution of a ripple contour function $C(x,z)$ and the transbilayer
electron density profile $T_\psi(x,z)$,
\begin{equation}
  \rho(x,z) = C(x,z) * T_\psi(x,z).
\end{equation}
The form factor $F(\mathbf{q})$ is the Fourier transform of the electron density.
By the convolution theorem, 
\begin{equation}
  F(\mathbf{q}) = F_C(\mathbf{q})F_T(\mathbf{q}),
\end{equation}
where \gls{FC} and \gls{FT} are the Fourier transform 
of $C(x,z)$ and $T_\psi(x,z)$, respectively.
We employed standard nonlinear least squares fitting procedures using
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
The software for data fitting was written in Python using 
the lmfit package \cite{ref:lmfit}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Contour Part of the Form Factor}\label{sec:contour}
As in Ref.\cite{ref:Sun96}, we take the ripple profile to have a sawtooth profile. Its
amplitude is \gls{A} and the projection of the major arm on the 
ripple direction is \gls{xM} as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:unit_cell}. 
Then, we write the ripple profile as
\begin{equation}
  u(x) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    -\frac{A}{\lambda_r-x_0}\left(x+\frac{\lambda_r}{2}\right) 
      & \text{for} 
      & -\frac{\lambda_r}{2} \leq x < -\frac{x_0}{2}, \\
    \frac{A}{x_0}x 
      & \text{for} 
      & -\frac{x_0}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{x_0}{2}, \\
    -\frac{A}{\lambda_r-x_0} \left(x-\frac{\lambda_r}{2}\right)
      & \text{for} 
      & \frac{x_0}{2} < x \leq \frac{\lambda_r}{2}.
    \end{array} \right.
  \label{eq:sawtooth}
\end{equation}
The ripple profile has inversion symmetry, so that the resulting
form factor is real. $A$ and $\xM$ are fitting parameters that depend 
on the integrated intensity of each peak while $D$, $\lambda_r$, and $\gamma$
are determined from measuring the positions of the Bragg peaks.

In order to allow the electron density along the ripple direction to 
modulate, we include two additional parameters, one to allow for the electron
density across the minor side to be different by a ratio \gls{f1} from the 
electron density across the major side and a second parameter \gls{f2}, which
is multiplied by $\delta$ functions $\delta(x \pm \xM/2)$ to allow for 
a different electron density near the kink between the major and the minor
sides. The full expression for the contour part of the form factor $\FC(\mathbf{q})$,
which is a two dimensional Fourier transform of Eq.~\ref{eq:sawtooth},
is found in Appendix~\ref{app:FC}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Transbilayer Part of the Form Factor}\label{sec:transbilayer}
The hybrid model developed by Wiener \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Wiener89} has
been successful in modeling the electron density profile in the gel phase.
The hybrid model with two Gaussian functions each representing the headgroup and
terminal methyl group was employed by Sun 
\textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Sun96}
for phasing the ripple phase X-ray data published by Wack and Webb \cite{ref:Wack89}.
We employed the same model for fitting our data 
since it was shown to be very successful in fitting the previous ripple X-ray data.
Because our data contain more data points at larger $q$, we also used
a model that has three  Gaussian functions, two of which represent the headgroup 
and the other one represents the terminal methyl group. 

In the hybrid model, the terminal methyl region of the bilayer is represented
as a Gaussian function \cite{ref:Wiener89}. The headgroups are represented by one 
and two Gaussian
functions in 1G and 2G hybrid models, respectively. The methylene and water 
regions are each treated as a constant. The gap between the two constants is 
represented by a sine function. Then, for half of the bilayer, 
$0 \leq z \leq D/2$, the electron density has the form, 
\begin{equation}
  \rho(z) = \rhog(z) + \rhos(z) + \rhob(z),
\end{equation}
where the Gaussian part is given by 
\begin{equation}
  \rhog(z) = \sum_{i=1}^{1\text{ or }2} \gls{rhoHi}
             e^{-(z-\gls{ZHi})^2/(2\gls{sigmaHi}^2)} + \gls{rhoM} e^{-z^2/(2\gls{sigmaM}^2)},
\end{equation}
the strip part is given by
\begin{equation}
  \rhos(z) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \rhochtwo & \text{for } & 0 \leq z < \zchtwo, \\
      \rhow   & \text{for } & \zw \leq z \leq D/2,
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}
and the bridging part is given by
\begin{equation}
  \rhob(z) = \frac{\rhow-\rhochtwo}{2} \cos \bracks{
    \frac{-\pi}{\deltazh}(z-\zw)} + \frac{\rhow+\rhochtwo}{2} \\
  \text{\quad for \quad} \zchtwo < z < \zw
\end{equation}
with $\deltazh=\zw-\zchtwo$. Here, we assume $\zh{2}>\zh{1}$. 
Table \ref{tab:zchtwozw} shows the definitions of $\zchtwo$ and $\zw$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \hline
     & 1G & 2G \\

The transbilayer profile along $x=-z\tan\psi$ can be obtained by rotating
the coordinates $x$ and $z$ by $\psi$ in the clockwise direction and
reexpressing $\rho(z)$ in terms of the rotated coordinates. This leads
to replacing $x$ with $x'=x\cos\psi+z\sin\psi$ and
$z$ with $z'=-x\sin\psi+z\cos\psi$. Then, the rotated transbilayer profile is
\begin{equation}
  \rho(x,z) = \delta(x+z\tan\psi)\bracks{\rhog(z') + \rhos(z') + \rhob(z')}.
  \label{eq:rotated_profile}
\end{equation}

Taking the two dimensional Fourier transform of Eq.~(\ref{eq:rotated_profile})
leads to the transbilayer part of the form factor,
\begin{align}
  F_\mathrm{T} 
  &= \int_{-\frac{D}{2}}^{\frac{D}{2}}\dz
     \int_{-\frac{\lambda_r}{2}}^{\frac{\lambda_r}{2}}\dx 
     \bracks{\rho(x,z)-\rhow} e^{i(q_xx+q_zz)} \\
  &= F_\mathrm{G} + F_\mathrm{S} + F_\mathrm{B}.
\end{align}
The form factor is calculated in the minus fluid convention, 
where the bilayer electron density
is measured with respect to the electron density of the surrounding solvent,
water \cite{ref:Worthington73}.
The expression for $F_\mathrm{T}$ is rather messy, so 
the derivation and full expression are in Appendix~\ref{app:FT}. Here, 
we note that
the fitting parameters in this model are $\zh{i}$, $\sigmah{i}$, and 
$\rhoh{i}$ for each of the two headgroup Gaussian functions, $\sigmam$ and
$\rhom$ for
the terminal methyl Gaussian, $\psi$ for
the lipid tilt, and an overall scaling factor. $\rhochtwo$ is absorbed into 
the overall scaling factor. The contour part of the 
form factor has four more parameters ($A$, $\xM$, $f_1$, and $f_2$).
In total, the modified 2G hybrid model implements 13 structural parameters.
Initially, we made $\zh{i}$, $\psi$, $A$, $\xM$, $f_1$, and $f_2$ free 
parameters
to guide the nonlinear least squares procedure to find a reasonable fit
while the other parameters were fixed to the corresponding gel phase values 
reported in Ref.~\cite{ref:Wiener89}. 
The best estimate of the gel phase structure was reported in
Ref.~\cite{Tristram-Nagle02}. Precise values for the fixed parameters
were not important because we then freed those parameters to find the best fit
once a reasonable initial fit was obtained.

\subsection{Some Results of Model Fitting}\label{sec:LAXS_model_results}
Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_models} summarizes representative fits obtained by a nonlinear
least squares fitting procedure. Fit1 and Fit2 were fits using the 1G hybrid model,
and Fit3--Fit7 were with the 2G hybrid model. As Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_models} shows, 
Fit5 produced the smallest $\chi^2$ value. This fit was found by 
starting with
Fit3, then freeing the widths of the three Gaussians (Fit4), 
and finally freeing the amplitudes of the Gaussians.
We also tried a different route; from Fit3, we freed 
the amplitudes of 
the Gaussians (Fit6) and then freed the Gaussian widths, 
arriving at Fit7. 
We consistently obtained model
form factors that were too small compared to the experimental ones 
for $(h,k)$ = (3, 0), (6, $k$), and (9, 0). This can be understood by
inspecting the contour part of the form factor $F_C(\mathbf{q})$ 
given by Eq.~\ref{eq:FC}.
The model form factor $F(\mathbf{q})$ is a product of
$F_C(\mathbf{q})$ and $F_T(\mathbf{q})$.
Figure~\ref{fig:FC} plots a two dimensional map of $|F_C(\mathbf{q})|$ for
$\lambda_r$ = 145 \AA, $A$ = 21.5 \AA, $\xM$ = 103 \AA, $f_1=0.5$,
and $f_2=-3$, values of which are taken from Fit5.
It shows that $|F_C(\mathbf{q})|$ is very small at 
($h, k$) = (3, 0), (6, 0)--(6,4), and (9, 0), leading to small values of
the model $F(\mathbf{q})$ for those peaks. These weak spots in $|\FC(\mathbf{q})|$
can be moved by varying $A$ and $\xM$. However, $A$ and $\xM$ are very 
sensitive to strong peaks that are on the white streak in Fig.~\ref{fig:FC}:
namely, ($h, k$) = (1, 0), (1, -1), (2, 0), (2, -1), (3, -1), (3, -2), and so on.
Then, for our data set, minima in the $\chi^2$ space are normally found
with values of $A$ and $\xM$ that result in $\FC(\mathbf{q})$ similar to the 
one shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FC}.
This analysis 
suggests that better fits to those underestimated orders may require a different model
for the contour part of the form factor rather than trying various
models for the transbilayer part of the form factor $\FT(\mathbf{q})$. 
Since the sawtooth profile is a very reasonable assumption, an improvement
should be made in modeling the kink regions.
For example, introducing a short plateau parallel to the ripple $x$-axis
instead of the sharp turn in the kink region of the current model would
lead to a band of intensity along the $q_z$ axis, which could bring about 
larger values of $|\FC(\mathbf{q})|$ at those underestimated peak positions.
We did not consider improving our models because we were only interested in the predicted
phases for calculating an electron density profile.

\subsection{Results for the Phase Factors}\label{sec:LAXS_phases_results}
It is important to emphasize that the goal of model fitting is to obtain the 
best phase factors $\Phi_{hk}$, not to obtain the best physical values for these 
structural parameters.  The best values of those parameters will be obtained 
in the next section~\ref{sec:LAXS_edp} by combining the phase factors we 
determine in this subsection with the experimental $|F_{hk}|$.  
Tables \ref{tab:LAXS_fits1} and \ref{tab:LAXS_fits2} show the phases that 
were determined by the various fits described in the previous subsection and 
listed in Table \ref{tab:LAXS_models}. The column labeled `consensus phase'
shows that the phase factor was the same for all the models for most of the 
reflections for which $\pm$ is entered.  Reflections with an asterisk in the 
consensus column are extinct, so any consensus phase factor is irrelevant for 
the electron density profile in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Fourier_reconstruction}). 
We flag phase factors with a question 
mark as being undetermined by the models.  In the case of the (1, 3) reflection, 
there is a near consensus that $\Phi_{13}=+1$, but the model values of 
$|F_{13}|$ are considerably smaller than the experimental value, suggesting 
that $\Phi_{13}$ might have either sign.  We have also flagged $\Phi_{7,-2}$ 
for this reason even though all models give $+1$. The most serious lack of 
consensus is for the (6, $k$) reflections where the best models Fit5 and Fit7 
give opposite signs. For the $(6,-3)$ reflection, both models give values of 
$|F_{6,-3}|$ similar in size to the experimental value which is well 
determined to be non-zero, but these two models give opposite $\Phi_{6,-3}$ 
phase factors.  This emphasizes that, while the phase problem has been 
considerably reduced from $2^{60}$, it is still necessary to consider several 
phase combinations to extract the best structural parameters.

\section{Electron Density Profiles and Coarse Grained Bilayer Structure}\label{sec:LAXS_edp}
This section concludes the LAXS analysis by 
presenting electron density maps  and structural parameters directly obtained from the maps. 
Structures obtained with the form factors from the unoriented and 
oriented sample are compared, showing that the differences in $F_{hk}^\text{un}$
and $F_{hk}^\text{ori}$ in Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack} are not significant for 
structural determination in this section.
Because the phase factors for several orders were ambiguous as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_phases_results}, 
our aim is to reveal robust features in the electron density maps by plotting several 
electron density maps
using different phase factor combinations. 
Even with the ambiguous phase factors, 
the out-of-plane structure of the ripple phase was determined well as will be shown.

Figure~\ref{fig:Fit5_2D_edp} plots a two dimensional electron density map calculated
using Eq.~(\ref{eq:Fourier_reconstruction})
with the phase factors obtained from Fit5  
and our experimental form factors in Tables~\ref{tab:LAXS_fits1} and \ref{tab:LAXS_fits2}.
The headgroups are electron dense and shown by white bands, which clearly indicate
the sawtooth profile reported by
previous X-ray diffraction studies \cite{ref:Sun96,ref:Sengupta03,ref:Pabst04}.
Another distinct feature seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fit5_2D_edp} is the 
presence of the methyl trough in the major arm, 
manifested by a black band along the bilayer center extending from 
$x \approx -50$ \AA\ to 50 \AA, which is not present in the minor arm.
The red lines follow the electron density peak $z$ position for the bilayer
centered at $z$ = 0, which define the headgroup $z$ positions \gls{zHead} as a function of $x$.
We define the ripple amplitude $A \equiv z_\text{max}-z_\text{min}$ = 18.2~\AA\ 
and the major arm length projected on the $x$-axis 
$\xM \equiv x_\text{max}-x_\text{min}$ = 97~\AA\
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:PF5_headgroup}).
These values are substantially different from the values obtained in the model fitting 
procedure ($A$~=~21.5~\AA\ and $\xM$~=~102.9~\AA; see Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_models}), 
so it is important to extract these structural parameters from the 
experimental electron density map. 
These values lead to the major arm tilt angle \gls{xiM}~=~10.6\textdegree\ and 
the minor arm tilt angle \gls{xim}~=~20.8\textdegree\
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:unit_cell} for definitions).
The $\zhead$ profile shows an unlikely zigzag feature in the minor arm region,
suggesting that some of the phase factors obtained in Fit5~(called PF5) are 
incorrect. This is also seen as a sharp turn in the electron density along the 
headgroups \gls{rhoHead} plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:PF5_headgroup}. 
The $\rhohead$ profile also shows an oscillation with wavelength $\sim$25 \AA\
in the major arm region,
a feature which might be removed by correcting one or more phase factors and/or
measuring even more reflections.

To compare the structure obtained with the form factors from the unoriented sample $|F_{hk}^\text{un}|$ to 
the oriented sample $|F_{hk}^\text{ori}|$,
we constructed four data sets shown in Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wackwebb1}.
The column $F_{hk}^\text{un,low}$ lists the form factors from the unoriented sample
of Wack and Webb \cite{ref:Wack89} with the phase factors 
reported by Sun \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Sun96};
the set of $(h,k)$ in this column will be called a low resolution set.
The column $F_{hk}^\text{ori,high}$ is the form factors from the oriented sample with the phase factors
of its low resolution set identical to the column $F_{hk}^\text{un,low}$ 
while the rest of the phase factors are identical to PF5 
(see the Fit5 column in Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_fits1} and \ref{tab:LAXS_fits2} for the phase factors of PF5).
The column $F_{hk}^\text{mix,high}$ was constructed by adding to the low resolution set from the 
unoriented sample (column $F_{hk}^\text{un,low}$) the form factors from the oriented sample 
(column $F_{hk}^\text{ori,high}$), 
and the column $F_{hk}^\text{ori,low}$ is the low resolution set of the column $F_{hk}^\text{ori,high}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:low-res_comparison} compares $\zhead$ and $\rhohead$ in the low resolution structures, 
obtained using the $F_{hk}$ values in the column $F_{hk}^\text{un,low}$ and $F_{hk}^\text{ori,low}$.
$A=17$~\AA\ and $\xM=89$~\AA\ were obtained using the column $F_{hk}^\text{un,low}$, 
and 18.1~\AA\ and 91~\AA\ using the column $F_{hk}^\text{ori,low}$.
The low resolution structure obtained with the unoriented data set agrees well with 
the one obtained with the oriented data set, indicating that the differences in the form factors obtained
from the unoriented and oriented sample shown in Table.~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack} were not significant.
The small differences in $A$ and $\xM$ are due to the different
ripple wavelengths $\lambda_r$ in the unoriented ($\lambda_r=141.7$~\AA) and 
oriented (145.0~\AA) data sets. 

Moving to the high resolution data sets, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:un_vs_ori} compares the $\zhead$ profile obtained using the
column $F_{hk}^\text{mix,high}$ and $F_{hk}^\text{ori,high}$. 
It shows that the difference in $\zhead$ between the unoriented
and oriented data becomes negligible when the high resolution data are included.
This means that the structural parameters such as $A$, $\xM$, and the major and
minor arm thicknesses obtained using our measured form factors from the
oriented sample are not affected by some disagreement between $|F_{hk}^\text{un}|$
and $|F_{hk}^\text{ori}|$ shown in Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wack}.
Figure~\ref{fig:high_vs_low} compares $\zhead$ and $\rhohead$ obtained using 
the column $F_{hk}^\text{ori,low}$ and $F_{hk}^\text{ori,high}$. 
It shows that when a high resolution set is included
in calculating the electron density map, major arms become longer by 
$\sim$6~\AA, leading to shorter and steeper minor arms.
Table~\ref{tab:oriented_vs_unoriented} summarizes the $A$ and $\xM$ values
obtained from unoriented, oriented, low, and high resolution data sets
listed in Table~\ref{tab:cmu_vs_wackwebb1}.

Figure~\ref{fig:PF1_2D_edp}--\ref{fig:PF7_2D_edp} show electron density maps
calculated using the phase factors obtained from various fits listed in
Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_fits1} and \ref{tab:LAXS_fits2}. 
The corresponding $\zhead(x)$ profiles plotted in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:PF1_headgroup}--\ref{fig:PF7_headgroup} show a range of $A$ and $\xM$,
which are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_DHH}.
The average values of $A$, $\xM$, $\xiM$, and $\xim$ are 
18.5 \AA, 99.2 \AA, 10.5\textdegree, and 22.0\textdegree, respectively.
A similar zigzag feature seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:PF5_headgroup} is present
in some but not all profiles, suggesting that this feature may be an artifact 
due to incorrect phase factors.
The $\rhohead(x)$ profiles show a plateau in the major arm except for some
oscillation, and they show a dip in the minor arm.

To obtain the thickness of the bilayer in the major arm, 
electron density profiles calculated
using the phases from various fits are 
plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:major_diff_models} 
along the slice shown by the straight dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fit5_2D_edp}
(Slice A).
Slice A is along the normal of the major arm and is centered in the middle of 
the hydrocarbon region. It indicates that the bilayer head-head spacing 
$D_\text{HH}^\text{major}$ is 40.0--42.0 \AA\ in the major arm
(see also Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_DHH}). 
Electron density profiles are also plotted along Slice B
in Fig.~\ref{fig:minor_diff_models}.
Slice B is
along the normal to the minor arm and is centered in the middle of the
hydrocarbon region. It indicates that $D_\text{HH}^\text{minor}$ is
29.2--31.0 \AA\ in the minor arm.
These results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_DHH}.

As noted in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_phases_results}, 
fits to $(h,k)$ = (3,~0), (6,~0)--(6,~4),
and (9,~0) were unsatisfactory. 
We also noticed that the phase of (1, 3) was unstable. 
To study how the electron density profile varies as the phase factors of those orders are varied,
we deliberately reversed various sets of those phase factors and recalculated the electron 
density map. Figure~\ref{fig:major_phase_variation}
and \ref{fig:minor_phase_variation} show the major and minor arm electron density
profiles for some combinations of the phases based on PF5. 
In PF5a, we only inverted the phase of (3, 0),
and in PF5b the phases of 
(1, 3), (3, 0), (6, 0), and (9, 0) were inverted.
In PF5c, we further reversed the sign of (6, 1--4) from PF5b.
Essentially, we obtained approximately the same $D_\text{HH}^\text{major}$
for the three cases. In contrast, the variation in $D_\text{HH}^\text{minor}$ was
larger, and in PF5c, $D_\text{HH}^\text{minor}$ = 31.8 \AA.
Also, the terminal methyl trough in the major arm was present in all profiles but
absent in the minor arm profiles.

In summary, we observed that the thickness of the minor arm was 
smaller than that of the major arm, and these thicknesses did not vary 
considerably considering different phase factors. 
Furthermore, the terminal methyl trough like feature in the major arm was 
quite robust, but 
whether the minor arm has a small dip or rise in the density at the bilayer center
was not determined. 
Figure~\ref{fig:major_arm_overlay} plots eight major arm electron density profiles 
obtained with various combinations of the phase factors, and
Fig.~\ref{fig:minor_arm_overlay} plots equivalent curves for the minor arm.
Without further analysis on the phase factors, 
all profiles plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:major_arm_overlay} and 
\ref{fig:minor_arm_overlay} are equally possible.
Elimination of one or more profiles could be done by an approach
similar to pattern recognition. For example, a set of the 
phase factors that reproduce more physically reasonable features in the electron
density map
could be favored over some of the phase factors we obtained from the fits.
Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_summary} summarizes
the final structural results, averaging the structural parameters
measured from electron density maps presented in this section.
We note that the quoted average values are not strictly statistical averages
but should be reasonable estimates for the parameters.

\section{nGIWAXS: Results}\label{sec:nGIWAXS_results}
\subsection{Fluid and Gel Phase}\label{sec:nGIWAXS_fluid_gel_phase}
Figure~\ref{fig:waxs_data_reduction} shows the data reduction of 
near grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (nGIWAXS) data of
the DMPC fluid phase at $T$ = 30 \textcelsius.
The scattering image taken at $\omega=0.5$\textdegree\ had unwanted
scattering due to mylar windows in the hydration chamber which
overlapped with the fluid phase WAXS 
and general background from air, He, and water vapor.
Subtracting background scattering data taken at incident angle $-\omega$  
removed these unwanted features in the scattering data, 
resulting in a sample scattering 
image, Fig.~\ref{fig:waxs_data_reduction} 
(bottom, left panel).
This sample scattering image was then transformed to the
sample $q$-space using the relationship between the CCD 
pixel positions and the sample $q$-space
given by Eq.~\ref{eq:qxqyqz} and Eq.~\ref{eq:XZ}. The nonlinearity of this
relationship is
not negligible and must be taken into account for wide angle scattering data.
The black regions in the sample $q$-space 
image, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:waxs_data_reduction}
(bottom, right panel),
are the regions of $q$-space that were
not probed by the detector when $\omega=0.5$\textdegree. 
Because of the nonlinearity in the 
transformation, straight detector edges were turned into curves, the effect of
which was most visible near the meridian $q_r$ = 0. All nGIWAXS data
in this chapter were reduced in the same manner.

Because of chain disordering in the fluid phase, chain-chain scattering
gives rise to diffuse scattering that is broad in both the $q_r$ and $q_z$ directions \cite{ref:Mills08}. 
These fluid phase data were collected with a low resolution setup to maximize
intensity. The low resolution 
($\Delta q_r$~0.032~\AA$^{-1}$) 
did not pose a problem for analysis of these 
data because observed features were broad. Fluid 
phase WAXS
is most intense at the equator. However, scattering very near the equator
was strongly absorbed by the sample and substrate, so observing the 
peak in the fluid phase WAXS required the tWAXS experimental 
geometry in the next section.  
Figure~\ref{fig:fluid_qr} plots intensity along $q_r$ showing that
the fluid phase WAXS was centered at $q \approx$ 1.41 \AA$^{-1}$. 
This corresponds to an average chain-chain distance of 4.5 \AA. 
A Lorentzian fit to the profile resulted in the full width half maximum
(FWHM) $\Delta q_r=0.288$ \AA$^{-1}$.

  2011 run. The sample width $w_s$ = 2 mm.
  The fluid phase LAXS is also visible near the beam.  
  The darker region below the equator defined by 
  the beam vertical position $p_z$ was due to the substrate. The beam
  was visible through the semitransparent beam stop.
  Scattering at $p_z >$ 750 was the shadow cast by the electrical wires 
  and thermal shielding in the hydration chamber.
  (bottom) The background subtracted 
  image (left) and corresponding image in the sample $q$-space (right).
  Except for some minor leftover scattering, background and mylar scattering was 
  removed. The weak scattering labelled Si also occured from a bare Si wafer.  
  Because the meridian was not exactly along the vertical
  pixels, the background subtracted image was rotated by $\sim$1\textdegree\
  in the clockwise direction before the $q$-space transformation. The data
  reduction was done using MATLAB.}

  water scattering, which led to a slightly asymmetric profile.

Figure~\ref{fig:gel_phase} shows nGIWAXS of the the DMPC L$_{\beta I}$ gel phase
that occurs at the highest hydration \cite{ref:Smith88,Tristram-Nagle02},
collected with the high resolution setup. Because exposure time was short,
the data did not have much intensity, but the (2,0) peak was clearly 
visible on the equator.
When the peak profile of the (2,0) peak in $q_r$ was fitted to a Lorentzian, 
we obtained an excellent fit with its FWHM $\Delta q_r = 0.014$ \AA$^{-1}$,
centered at $q_r$ = 1.479 \AA$^{-1}$.
This is the instrumental resolution as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:geometric_broadening}.

  which is the same as the instrumental resolution 
  estimated in Sec.~\ref{sec:instrumental_resolution}.
  The scattering appears weak compared to fluid phase scattering shown in 
  Fig.~\ref{fig:fluid_qr} because the high resolution employed here had 100 
  times smaller intensity.}

\subsection{Ripple Phase}\label{sec:nGIWAXS_ripple_phase}
Figure~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS_enlarge} shows nGIWAXS from an oriented DMPC film
in the ripple phase for $D$ = 60.8 \AA, collected with the high resolution setup. 
We observed a stronger peak and a weaker one off the equator. 
The maximum intensity of the stronger peak was at 
$(q_r, q_z) \approx (1.478 \pm 0.002 \text{ \AA}^{-1}, 0.20 \pm 0.01 \text{ \AA}^{-1})$ as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:qrplots}. The weaker peak was observed closer to the equator, and
separation of this peak from the stronger one was visible between 
$q_z$ = 0.10 and 0.14 \AA$^{-1}$, indicating that the center of this peak was approximately
$(q_r, q_z) \approx (1.457 \pm 0.004 \text{ \AA}^{-1}, 0.12 \pm 0.02 \text{ \AA}^{-1})$. 
Because of absorption of X-rays due to the sample, 
intensity became attenuated as one approaches the equator.
Very close to the equator, there is Vineyard-Yoneda 
peak that is due to constructive interference with scattering from the substrate
\cite{ref:Vineyard82,ref:Miller08},
which we will not consider.
Absorption and Vineyard-Yoneda peak did not affect determination of the 
ripple peak positions
as the ripple peaks were located at sufficiently large $q_z$. 
The positions of the peaks were consistent with those observed in 
transmission wide angle scattering, which is discussed in the next section.

  intensity along the line slightly above $q_z$ = 0 \AA$^{-1}$ is Vineyard-Yoneda
  scattering involving the substrate \cite{ref:Vineyard82,ref:Miller08}.}

  \label{fig:qrplots}
\end{figure}

We also investigated dependence of the ripple WAXS on the interbilayer
$D$-spacing. Figure~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS} compares nGIWAXS at two different 
$D$-spacings,
showing that chain scattering did not depend on the $D$-spacing in this range. 
Figure~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS} (left) also shows a weak feature that looks like an 
arc coming from the chain peak, quantified in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:sector_plots}. This feature extended
from $\phi$ = 0\textdegree\ to at least 60\textdegree, and
is likely to be scattering due to mosaic spread.

  \label{fig:sector_plots}
\end{figure}

We estimated the width of the stronger peak by fitting 
the intensity profile in $q_r$ to two Lorentzians as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:strong_peak}. The fit resulted in the FWHM $\Delta q_r$
= 0.025 \AA$^{-1}$ centered at 1.478 \AA$^{-1}$ and 
$\Delta q_r$ = 0.140 \AA$^{-1}$ centered at 1.464 \AA$^{-1}$.
A fit with a single Lorentzian was not very good, and 
a broader Lorentzian was necessary to produce a reasonable fit. 
We also fitted the peak profile in $q_r$ at $q_z$ = 0.12 \AA$^{-1}$,
where two distinct peaks were observed (Fig.~\ref{fig:weak_peak}).
The two sharp peaks fitted with Lorentzians yielded the FWHM of about 
0.025 \AA$^{-1}$, consistent with the FWHM obtained for the stronger 
peak. The widths and positions of the observed peaks are summarized
in Table~\ref{tab:nGIWAXS_summary}.

As Fig.~\ref{fig:weak_peak}
shows, the double Lorentzian fit was only successful within a limited range
in $q_r$. This could be due to an underlining broad peak like the one
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:strong_peak}. To investigate this possibility,
we fitted the same peak profile with three Lorentzians with fixed widths.
Two of the Lorentzians had fixed widths of 0.025 \AA$^{-1}$ representing 
the sharp peaks, and the last one had a fixed width of 0.14 \AA$^{-1}$
representing the broad peak. Figure~\ref{fig:weak_peak} shows an excellent
fit obtained over a large range in $q_r$, suggesting that the estimated
peak widths are not unreasonable.
Curiously, the center of the stronger peak was different at the two 
different $q_z$: ($q_r$, $q_z$) = (1.485 \AA$^{-1}$, 0.12 \AA$^{-1}$)
and (1.478 \AA$^{-1}$, 0.2 \AA$^{-1}$), while the total $q$ was about
the same, $\sim$1.49 \AA$^{-1}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:ripple_waxs_low-res} shows the low resolution nGIWAXS of DMPC
at $D=61.0$~\AA, with the intensity $\sim$10 times greater than the high resolution
nGIWAXS shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS_enlarge}. 
The low resolution ripple WAXS pattern was similar to the high resolution one,
and we did not see any weak feature that could not be observed
with the high resolution experiment. 
Figure~\ref{fig:ripple_waxs_low-res_qrplots} plots the intensities in $q_r$ at
$q_z=0.012$ and 0.020~\AA$^{-1}$. Due to the low instrumental resolution,
the stronger and weaker Bragg rods were not separated; otherwise,
the peak profiles were similar to those in the high resolution nGIWAXS shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:qrplots}, indicating that the statistics of the high resolution
data were adequate for the ripple WAXS. For completeness, radial intensity
profiles $I(q)$ of the low resolution nGIWAXS are plotted in

\section{tWAXS: Results}\label{sec:tWAXS_results}
Figure~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel} (left) shows background subtracted transmission wide
angle X-ray scattering (tWAXS) of the DMPC gel \LbetaI\ phase obtained at 
$\omega$ = 45\textdegree.
The background scattering image was collected by replacing 
the sample with a bare Si wafer. Imperfect subtraction of mylar scattering 
can be seen in the background subtracted image. 
This was most likely due to slight displacement of mylar windows
when the sample was replaced with a bare wafer. 
Three main reflections whose Miller indices 
are (2,~0), (1,~1), and (1,~-1) were observed along with the (1,~$\pm$1) satellite 
peaks.
Because the data were taken at $\omega=45$\textdegree, the WAXS pattern 
appeared on the CCD detector very differently from the respective pattern
in the sample $q$-space. 
Therefore, the CCD to $q$-space transformation shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel} (right) was important in analyzing the tWAXS data.

  $L_{\beta I}$ phase observed on
  the CCD detector (left) and its corresponding pattern in the sample $q$-space
  (right). Bragg rods were indexed as (2, 0), (1, 1) and (1, -1). The satellite 
  peaks of (1, $\pm$1) reflections were also labeled. The black region in
  the right image corresponds to inaccesible $q$-space at 
  $\omega$~=~45\textdegree. The edges
  of the sample $q$-space image were distorted due to the nonlinear relation
  between the detector pixels and the sample $q$-space as discussed in 
  Sec.~\ref{sec:nGIWAXS_results}. A ring of intensity
  at $q \approx$ 0.9 \AA$^{-1}$ is due to imperfect subtraction of the mylar
  scattering. Residual mylar scattering is also visible near and at slightly 
  larger $q$ than the (2, 0) Bragg rod.}
  \label{fig:twaxs_gel}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel_qr} plots intensity of the \LbetaI\ (2,~0) Bragg rod in $q_r$
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel}. A Lorentzian fit to the intensity profile was excellent, 
with the FWHM $w=0.020$~\AA$^{-1}$. This value is the same as the instrumental resolution
$\Delta q_r$ estimated in Table~\ref{tab:instrumental_resolution}. As was the case 
for the nGIWAXS (see Sec.~\ref{sec:nGIWAXS_fluid_gel_phase}), a Gaussian did not
fit the data well, indicating that the resolution function for our
WAXS experiments could be approximated by a Lorentzian but not Gaussian.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:twaxs_ripple} shows the tWAXS pattern of the ripple phase 
after the CCD to $q$-space transformation. The stronger
peak observed in nGIWAXS was also observed at approximately the same location.
Because of a lower instrumental resolution than in the nGIWAXS experiment,
the weaker peak was not as well separated from the stronger peak. 
Figure~\ref{fig:twaxs_weak_qr} (right) shows
a hint of the weak peak at $q_z=0.12$ \AA$^{-1}$. This
data set taken in the 2011 run motivated
the higher instrumental resolution nGIWAXS experiments
in the 2013 run, but it was not possible to do tWAXS on that run.

The length $L_z=L\cos\theta$ of scattering entities in the bilayer normal $z$ direction can be estimated by 
measuring the full length $\Delta q_z$ of the (2,~0) Bragg rod in $q_z$ in
the $L_{\beta I}$ phase \cite{ref:Tristram93},
the relation between them being $\Delta q_z = 4\pi/L_z$ 
from the $\textrm{sinc}(q_zL_z/2)$ dependence from simple single slit 
diffraction. 
Figure~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel_qz} (left) shows intensity of observed Bragg rods along $q_z$ averaged in $q_r$
for the gel and ripple phases. The full length $\Delta q_z$ for the (2, 0) gel
phase peak shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel_qz} was measured to be 
$\sim$0.4 \AA$^{-1}$, corresponding to 
$L_z \approx 31$ \AA. 
This corresponds to the hydrocarbon thickness 2\gls{Dc}~=~30.2~\AA\  
reported by \cite{Tristram-Nagle02}. 
This value of $L_z$, or $L\approx 37$~\AA\ using $\theta=32.3$\textdegree,
indicates that chains in the upper and
lower monolayers scatter coherently, which has been shown to be the case
for DMPC \cite{ref:Smith88} and DPPC \cite{ref:Tristram93}.
Figure~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel_qz}~(right) compares $\Delta q_z$ in the ripple and gel phases,
showing that $\Delta q_z$ was almost the same in both phases. Therefore, 
chains in the ripple phase are also coupled between the monolayers. 
We note that mosaic spread of the sample would make the apparent $\Delta q_z$ 
larger, but negligibly so as the angle subtended by the Bragg rod is $\tan^{-1}(0.4/1.5)=15$\textdegree, 
far larger than the mosaicity.

Finally, Fig.~\ref{fig:twaxs_qzplot} plots $q_z$ swaths along the weaker 
Bragg rod and along the entire ripple WAXS pattern. 
We found no obvious intensity maxima
near the equator, confirming that the center of the weaker Bragg rod also 
has non-zero $q_z$ as was suggested in Sec.~\ref{sec:nGIWAXS_results}.
There was also no sign of a third feature, and deconvolution of intensity
was consistent with two Bragg rods overlapping 
with their full lengths given by $\sim$0.4~\AA$^{-1}$.

\section{Thin Rod Model}\label{sec:thin_rod_model}
We attempt to understand the WAXS data by considering models for the chain 
packing.  As the prevailing hypothesis is that the major arm of the ripple is 
like a gel phase, we begin by reviewing gel phase models in the next subsection.  
We then consider the scattering consequences of tilting these models out of 
plane by the angle $\xiM\approx$~10.5\textdegree\ obtained from the LAXS analysis.

\subsection{Gel Phase Model}\label{sec:gel_model}
The fully hydrated gel phase of DMPC consists of hydrocarbon chains that are 
basically straight and cooperatively tilted by an angle $\theta$ from the 
bilayer normal \cite{ref:Smith88,ref:Tristram93,ref:Sun94,Tristram-Nagle02}. 
This is called the $L_{{\beta}I}$ phase in which each chain is tilted toward 
a nearest neighbor chain. At lower hydration the chains tilt differently. 
We will also focus on the $L_{{\beta}F}$ phase in this section.  The chains 
will be modeled as thin rods.  The basic geometry of the $L_{{\beta}I}$ 
and \LbetaF\ phases
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_thin_rod}.  
Ref.~\cite{ref:Sun94} emphasized that the chains 
are tilted in the same direction in both monolayers. It also allowed for 
translational offsets that we will set to zero for simplicity.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ripple/thin_rod_model/gel_thin_rod}
  \caption[Lattice and geometry of thin rod model]
  {Lattice and geometry of thin rod model. 
  The chains are represented as solid lines. The unit cell is drawn
  in the dashed lines.
  Top views of \LbetaI, \LbetaF, and \LbetaL\ phases (top)
  and side views of \LbetaI\ and \LbetaF\ (bottom) are shown.
  $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are unit cell vectors, and $a > b$.
  $\phi$ is an in-plane azimuthal angle. 
  $\theta$ is the chain tilt angle with respect to the bilayer normal $z$.  
  Chains are tilted toward the nearest neighbor in the \LbetaI\ phase with 
  $\phi=\pi/2$. The \LbetaI\ phase is observed in the fully hydrated gel 
  phase of DMPC. In the \LbetaF\ phase, the chains are tilted toward the next
  nearest neightbor ($\phi=0$).}
  \label{fig:gel_thin_rod}
\end{figure}

The unit cell customarily employed is indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_thin_rod}.  
For the $L_{{\beta}I}$ phase, the chains 
are tilted along the \gls{b} direction 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_thin_rod} and along the \gls{a} direction for 
the $L_{{\beta}F}$ phase.  
It may be noted that chain packing in a plane that is perpendicular to the 
chains (and therefore not parallel to the bilayer) is nearly hexagonal; if 
the packing were hexagonal and if the chains had zero tilt, then in Fig. 1c 
one would have $b=a/\sqrt{3}$, which becomes $b=a/(\cos{\theta}\sqrt{3})$ with tilt.  
The Laue conditions for allowed reflections are 
\begin{equation}\label{Laue1}
  q_x=\frac{2 \pi m}{a}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{Laue2}
  q_y=\frac{2 \pi n}{b}, 
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $n$ are integers.
Eq.~\ref{Laue1} and \ref{Laue2} 
establish the location of possible lines of scattering (Bragg rods). 
The modulation of the intensity along these rods is derived from the square 
of the unit cell form factor
\begin{equation}\label{S(q)}
  F(\mathbf{q}) = \int_{0}^{a}dx\int_{0}^{b}dy
  \int_{-\frac{L}{2}\cos\theta}^{\frac{L}{2}\cos\theta}
  \dz\rho(\mathbf{r})\exp(i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}).
\end{equation}
Our thin rods are modeled as delta functions
\begin{equation}\label{rods}
  \rho(\mathbf{r})=\delta(x-{\alpha}z,y-{\beta}z)+\delta(x-a/2-{\alpha}z,y-b/2-{\beta}z)
\end{equation}
where for the general case that the chain tilt is oriented at angle \gls{phi} 
relative to the $x$ axis 
\begin{equation}\label{alpha}
  \alpha=\tan{\theta}\cos{\phi}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{beta}
  \beta=\tan{\theta}\sin{\phi}.
\end{equation}
For the $L_{{\beta}I}$ phase, $\phi={\pi}/2$ and for the $L_{{\beta}F}$ phase, 
$\phi=0$ .  Continuing with the general $\phi$ case for awhile,
defining $\gamma = {\alpha}q_x+{\beta}q_y+q_z$ yields
\begin{equation}\label{S(q)}
  F(\mathbf{q}) = \int_{-\frac{L}{2}\cos{\theta}}^{\frac{L}{2}\cos{\theta}}\dz
  \rho(\mathbf{r})e^{i{\gamma}z}(1+e^{\frac{q_xa}{2}+\frac{q_yb}{2}}).
\end{equation}
The phase factor $1+e^{q_xa/2+q_yb/2}$ vanishes unless the sum $m+n$ of the 
Laue indices $(mn)$ is even. Only the lowest orders $(\pm2,0)$ and $(\pm1,\pm1)$ 
have observable intensity.  For the simple thin rod model in Eq.~\ref{rods} 
\begin{equation}\label{int}
  F(q_z) = \frac{4}{\gamma}\sin\left(\frac{\gamma L\cos{\theta}}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
so the intensity $|F(q_z)|^2$ is modulated along each Bragg rod and maximum 
intensity occurs when $\gamma=0$ which, upon reversing the convention for the 
sign of $q_z$, means that the wide angle peaks are centered at
\begin{equation}\label{centers}
  q_z^{mn}={\alpha}q_x+{\beta}q_y=\alpha\frac{2\pi{m}}{a}+\beta\frac{2\pi{n}}{b}.
\end{equation}
For the $L_{{\beta}I}$ phase with ${\phi}={\pi}/2$, one has
\begin{equation}\label{20LbI}
  0=q_{z{\beta}I}^{20}=q_{z{\beta}I}^{-20}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{11LbI}
  \frac{2\pi}{b}\tan{\theta}=q_{z{\beta}I}^{11}=q_{z{\beta}I}^{-11}=-q_{z{\beta}I}^{1-1}=-q_{z{\beta}I}^{-1-1}
\end{equation}
For the $L_{{\beta}F}$ phase with ${\phi}=0$
\begin{equation}\label{20LbF}
  \frac{4\pi}{a}\tan{\theta}=q_{z{\beta}F}^{20}=-q_{z{\beta}F}^{-20}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{11LbF}
  \frac{2\pi}{a}\tan{\theta}=q_{z{\beta}F}^{11}=q_{z{\beta}F}^{1-1}=-q_{z{\beta}F}^{-11}=-q_{z{\beta}F}^{-1-1}
\end{equation}
One can verify, using these equations and the Laue equations for $q_x$ and $q_y$ 
that the magnitudes $q^{{\pm}20}$ and $q^{{\pm}1{\pm}1}$ of the total scattering 
vectors are equal when the packing of the chains is hexagonal in the tilted chain 
plane.  

In $q$-space the powder averaged gel phase pattern consists of circles 
in $q_x$ and $q_y$ centered on $q_x=0=q_y$ and with the values of $q_z$ given 
in Eqs.~\ref{20LbI}--\ref{11LbF}.  
The location of observed scattering in lab space $\mathbf{k}$ is obtained using 
the Ewald sphere, centered at $\mathbf{k}=0$ with radius $2\pi/\lambda$ and with 
the $\mathbf{q}=0$ center of the $q$-space pattern located 
at $\mathbf{k}=(0,|\mathbf{k}|,0)$.  The $q$-space pattern is tilted by the 
angle $\omega$ when the sample is tilted relative to the laboratory frame; for 
grazing incidence, the $q_z$ and $k_z$ axes are parallel and offset 
by $2\pi/\lambda$ in the $k_y$ beam direction.  The direction of scattering for 
the powder averaged gel phase is given by the laboratory $\mathbf{k}$ values 
where the $q$-space pattern intersects the Ewald sphere.  Each of the $(mn)$ 
rings generally intersects twice with opposite signs for $k_x$ corresponding to 
opposite sides of the meridian on the CCD.  The only rings that give obervable 
scattering in the gel phase are the $(\pm20)$ and the $(\pm1\pm1)$ rings.  
However, some of these six rings may coincide. For the $L_{{\beta}I}$ phase 
$(\pm20)$, $(\pm11)$ and $(\pm1-1)$ are pairwise identical, so there are three 
primary reflections on each side of the meridian. For the $L_{{\beta}F}$ phase 
$(1\pm1)$ and $(-1\pm1)$ are pairwise identical, so there are four primary peaks 
on each side of the meridian.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Ripple Model}\label{sec:ripple_model}
A reasonable hypothesis is that the major arm of the ripple has similar 
internal structure to a gel phase, with the major   difference that the plane 
of the major arm is tilted relative to the substrate.  That suggests that the 
predicted ripple pattern might be the same as would be obtained by tilting the 
in-plane powder averaged gel phase.  However, this would be a fundamental error 
because the operations of tilting and in-plane powder averaging do not commute.  
It is necessary first to tilt the gel phase $q$-space pattern and then to 
powder average it about the laboratory $k_z$ axis.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ripple/thin_rod_model/unit_cell_combined}
  \caption[(left) Projection of the unit cell ($a$, $b$) on the laboratory ($x$, $y$) plane]
  {(left) Projection of the unit cell ($a$, $b$) on the laboratory ($x$, $y$) plane.  
  The unit cell is rotated by $\zeta$ compared to $a$ being parallel to $x$ and the 
  direction of chain tilt is rotated by $\phi$ from the $a$ axis. 
  (right) Without loss of generality, the ripple direction is shown along 
  the $y$ axis and the major side is tilted by $\xi$.  Supposing that the chains 
  are tilted in the $y$ direction only, then the corresponding gel phase could 
  be any L$_{\beta\text{L}}$ phase constrained only by 
  $\phi$ + $\zeta$ = $\pi/2$, including the 
  special L$_{\beta\text{I}}$ phase with $\phi=\pi/2$ and $\zeta=0$ and the 
  special L$_{\beta\text{F}}$ phase with $\phi=0$ and $\zeta=\pi/2$.}
  \label{fig:thin_rod_model}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the axis for tilting matters, so it is important to define all 
angles carefully as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:thin_rod_model}.  
We continue to define the chain tilt angle relative to the 
bilayer normal by $\theta$.  The tilt of the major arm will be defined by a 
rotation angle $\xi$ about an axis in the $(x,y)$ plane and the angle that 
this axis makes with the $x$ axis will be defined to be $\zeta$.  Starting 
from the $q$ values obtained for the various gel phases, the proper order of 
rotations is first to rotate the orientation of the lattice with respect to 
the lab frame; this involves the standard rotation of the $(x,y)$ plane about 
the $z$ axis by angle $\zeta$.  Then, the gel phase is rotated about the new 
in-plane $x$ axis. The rotated $q$ value will be denoted $\tilde{q}$ which 
has components
\begin{equation}\label{qtz}
  \tilde{q}_{z}^{mn}=q_{z}^{mn}\cos{\xi}+q_{x}^{mn}\sin{\xi}sin{\zeta}-q_{y}^{mn}\sin{\xi}\cos{\zeta},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{qtx}
  \tilde{q}_{x}^{mn}=q_{x}^{mn}\cos{\zeta}+q_{y}^{mn}\sin{\zeta},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{qty}
  \tilde{q}_{y}^{mn} = q_{y}^{mn}\cos\xi\cos\zeta -
                       q_{x}^{mn}\cos\xi\sin\zeta +
                       q_{z}^{mn}\sin\xi.
\end{equation}
As there are many domains in each x-ray exposure, the next step powder averages 
each $(mn)$ reflection by rotating about the $z$ axis from $0$ to $2\pi$.  
As for the gel phase, the ensuing $q$ space pattern consists of circles parallel 
to the $(x,y)$ plane with center at $(0, 0, q_z^{mn})$.  As noted above for the 
gel phase, this pattern is tilted by $\omega$ when the substrate is tilted for 
our transmission experiments.  Intersections of these circles with the Ewald 
sphere determines the angle of scattering in the laboratory from which, by 
standard equations (Sec.~\ref{sec:sample_q-space}), the $\mathbf{q}_{mn}$ are determined.  

The most pertinent component is $\tilde{q}_z^{mn}$ as this primarily determines 
how far reflections are from the meridian.  As there are many variable angles, 
let us consider $\tilde{q}_z^{mn}$ for the most pertinent special cases.  It is 
appropriate here to consider only $\omega=0$ because experimental data with 
$\omega\neq 0$ are easily converted to this standard orientation.  We will 
focus on four special cases.  First, consider the in-plane orientation ${\zeta}$ 
of the lattice to have either the longer $a$ axis parallel (${\zeta}=0$) or 
perpendicular (${\zeta}={\pi}/2$) to the ripple direction.  It may be noted 
that these two special directions allow uniform packing of the unit cells along 
the finite ripple direction, whereas the edges of the unit cells are ragged at 
the boundaries of the major arm for other values of ${\zeta}$.  Also, these two 
directions are symmetrical.  However, as the lipid molecules are chiral and as 
there is likely disorder at the boundaries of the major arm, one cannot 
eliminate general ${\zeta}$ angles {\it a priori}.  We will also focus on the 
special orientations of the tilt direction that correspond to the $L_{{\beta}I}$ 
gel phase ($\phi=\pi/2$), which we will henceforth call $P_{{\beta}I}^{\zeta}$ 
phases, and the $L_{{\beta}F}$ gel phase ($\phi=0$), to be called 
$P_{{\beta}F}^{\zeta}$ phases, recognizing, of course, that we are only modeling 
the major arm of the $P_{\beta'}$ ripple phase.   It will also be convenient to 
simplify to hexagonal packing of the hydrocarbon chains as the orthorhombic 
symmetry breaking that makes $q_\text{total}^{20} \neq q_\text{total}^{11}$ is small; 
then, $b=a/(\sqrt{3}\cos{\theta})$ for the $P_{{\beta}I}^{\zeta}$ phases and 
$b=a\cos{\theta}/\sqrt{3}$ for the $P_{{\beta}F}^{\zeta}$ phases.  These 
simplifications allow us to focus on the chain tilt angle $\theta$ and the 
tilt $\xi$ of the major side for four cases of $(\phi,\zeta)$ and the 
observable orders $({\pm}2,0)$ and (${\pm}1,{\pm}1)$.  The following table 
shows the values of $q_z^{mn}$, all divided by $2\pi/a$.  

Importantly, tilting the gel phase to form putative ripple major arms breaks 
the degeneracy of many of the gel phase rings.  Most notably, all the 
degeneracies are broken in the $P_{{\beta}I}^{\zeta=\pi/2}$ special case 
whereas none are broken in $P_{{\beta}F}^{\zeta=\pi/2}$.  The magnitude of the 
$q_z$ symmetry breaking is typically 
$(4{\pi}/a)\sin{\xi} \approx$ 0.32~\AA$^{-1}$  
for $\xi=10.5$\textdegree.  
As ${\Delta}q_z \approx 0.4$\AA, broken symmetry Bragg rods would be predicted 
to overlap considerably.  This could blur them into apparently single Bragg 
rods, but with larger ${\Delta}q_z$ than the intrinsic value of each Bragg rod.

\section{Combining WAXS and LAXS Results for the Major Arm}\label{sec:waxs_results}
Table~\ref{tab:waxs_structure} lists our new WAXS results for the ripple phase 
and some older results for the gel phase \cite{Tristram-Nagle02}. The definitions
of the structural quantities in Table~\ref{tab:waxs_structure} are illustrated
in Fig.~\ref{fig:chain_length}. As for the 
well hydrated \LbetaI\ gel phase, the total $q$ for independent 
reflections is different due to orthorhombic symmetry breaking of hexagonal 
chain packing, but the difference is smaller for our ripple data, so we have 
ignored this in our models in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_model}.  
Our experimental result for ${\Delta}q_z$ in Sec.~\ref{sec:tWAXS_results} for the two ripple Bragg 
rods corresponds to scattering units with length $L_z$ equal to the hydrocarbon 
thickness that is often called 2$D_c$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:chain_length}). 
Overlap of Bragg rods required by the 
symmetry breaking that occurs in three of the four models described 
in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_model} would require that each Bragg rod arise from a coherent scattering 
length even larger than a bilayer. As that is an unorthodox possibility, let 
us focus on the only case in Table~\ref{tab:special_cases} that does not have 
symmetry breaking, namely the $P_{\beta F}^{\zeta=\pi/2}$ phase. For this 
phase $q_z^{20}$ is twice as large as for $q_z^{{\pm}11}$,
which is consistent with the ratio of the experimental peak 
positions, $q_z$ = 0.2 $\pm$ 0.01 and 0.12 $\pm$ 0.02. 
Using our LAXS result $\xiM$ = 10.5\textdegree\ from Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_summary} 
and the experimental values in Table~\ref{tab:nGIWAXS_summary} gives 
%$a$ = 8.95 \AA\ and 
$\theta$ = 18.4\textdegree. This is considerably smaller than for the well 
hydrated \LbetaI\ phase. Table~\ref{tab:waxs_structure} also has an entry 
for the \LbetaF\ gel phase that was obtained from Fig.~6 in \cite{Tristram-Nagle02} for a 
sample that had been partially dehydrated so that the lamellar $D$ spacing was 
7~\AA\ smaller and the tilt angle had decreased to 20\textdegree. The ripple 
samples that we have focused on also have $D$ spacings about 7~\AA\ smaller 
than full hydration ($D_\text{FH}\approx 66.0$~\AA \cite{ref:Zhang95}).  
We therefore advance the 
hypothesis that our ripple samples have major arms that are like the 
$L_{\beta F}$ gel phase rather than like the $L_{\beta I}$ gel phase.

A further test of this hypothesis is that the thickness of the major arm is 
consistent with our LAXS result that gave a head-head thickness 
$\DHH$ = 41.2 \AA\ from Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_summary}. In the gel phase, the 
distance from the peak in the electron density profile to the Gibbs dividing 
surface for the hydrocarbon core has been found to be about 5 \AA
~\cite{Tristram-Nagle02}, so we estimate the ripple hydrocarbon thickness 
2$D_c$ to be 31.2 \AA, a bit larger than the gel phase value. However, the 
smaller tilt angle implies that the chain length $\lch$ is smaller, using 
$\lch=D_c/\cos{\theta}$ with values shown in Table~\ref{tab:waxs_structure}.  
This difference is reasonable as the ripple phase occurs at higher temperature 
and more rotameric defects would be expected to occur.  Indeed, one 
$g^+tg^-$ kink per chain would reduce the chain length by 1.27~\AA\ 
\cite{ref:Trauble71,ref:Nagle80}
which could
account for the difference in $\lch$ in Table~\ref{tab:waxs_structure}
between the gel and ripple phases.  
Chain shortening disorder is also consistent with the larger distance 
between neighboring ripple chains $d_{cc}$ in Table \ref{tab:waxs_structure}.  
More disorder is also consistent with the shorter chain-chain correlation 
length implied by the larger ${\Delta}q_r$ in Table~\ref{tab:nGIWAXS_summary}.

While the positions of the observed peaks are consistent
with the major arm of the ripple being a slightly disordered and tilted 
$L_{\beta F}$ structure, 
the relative intensities in those Bragg rods do not easily conform. 
In the $L_{\beta F}$ structure the Bragg rod with peak at smaller $q_z$ is a 
superposition of the (1, 1) and (-1, 1) Bragg rods whereas the rod with peak 
at larger $q_z$ arises only from the (2,0) rod.  When the chains are modeled as 
thin rods, the relative intensities 
of (2, 0), (1, 1) and (-1, 1) would all be equal, giving a factor of 2 in the 
ratio of observed intensities, but the experimental relative intensity ratio 
is at most 2/3. Of course, all-trans chains are not thin rods but the carbons 
zigzag in a plane, and there have been recent calculations that suggest that 
these intensity ratios can vary considerably depending on yet another angle, 
the azimuthal rotation of the chains about their long axis \cite{ref:Akabori14,ref:Watkins14}.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:ripple_discussion}
\subsection{Major Arm}
%\paragraph{Major arm}
There is significant evidence suggesting that the major arm is like 
the gel phase \cite{ref:Tardieu73,ref:Schneider83,ref:Sun96,ref:Riske09}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:gel_comparison} compares our electron density
profile in the major arm to the DMPC gel phase profile reported by 
Tristram-Nagle \textit{et al.} \cite{Tristram-Nagle02}. 
It shows that the density profile of the major arm is similar to that 
of the gel phase, and the thickness is comparable between the two phases
although the ripple profile does not show distinction
between the phosphate and carbonyl-glycerol headgroups as in the gel phase.
Also, the terminal methyl trough appears to be wider in the ripple major arm,
which could be a sign that the terminal methyl is more disordered
in the ripple phase than in the gel phase.
As discussed in
Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_edp}, however, small features in the ripple profile are not
reliable because they depend on which phase factors were used
to calculate the electron density profile.

  \cite{Tristram-Nagle02}. The ripple major arm profiles were calculated 
  using the phase factors obtained from Fit2, 5, and 7 (black, red, and green, respectively). 
  The ripple profiles are scaled vertically to match 
  with the gel phase profile.}
  \label{fig:gel_comparison}
\end{figure}

tWAXS results further emphasize the gel-like nature of the major arm.
Figure~\ref{fig:twaxs_gel_qz} shows that the lengths of the Bragg
rods in the ripple and gel phases are approximately the same, indicating that
chains in different leaflets in the ripple major arm also scatter coherently.

With the thin rod model developed in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_model}, we indexed 
the stronger Bragg rod as (2,~0) and weaker one as (1,~$\pm$1). 
The chain tilt angle $\theta=18.4$\textdegree\
(see Table~\ref{tab:waxs_structure}) is consistent with the gel 
$L_{\beta F}$ phase, supporting our interpretation that chains
are in the $P_{\beta F}$ phase.
With the result from the tWAXS analysis that chains in opposing leaflets
scatter coherently, Fig.~\ref{fig:major-arm_cartoon} (top) sketches
our proposed chain packing in the major arm, where
chains are tilted in the $xz$-plane with respect to the bilayer normal.
This interpretation of the WAXS data is consistent with 
Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_comparison}, 
which shows that the major arm thickness is 
comparable to the gel phase bilayer thickness, indicating that chains 
in the ripple major arm are also tilted with respect to the bilayer normal.

On the other hand, 
Sengupta \textit{et al.} proposed that major arm chains are oriented
nearly parallel to the bilayer normal \cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03},
see Fig.~\ref{fig:major-arm_cartoon} (bottom). 
This chain orientation would lead to a bilayer thickness $\DHH=44.9$~\AA\
with all-trans chains, somewhat thicker than our major arm of $\DHH=41.2$~\AA.  
However, we have argued in Sec.~\ref{sec:waxs_results} that the chains must be 
slightly disordered for our model; applying a similar argument to the
model in \cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03} would reduce their predicted 
bilayer thickness to $\DHH=42.4$~\AA\, sufficiently close to our measured value 
that thickness can not be used to rule out their model.  
More importantly, the
Bragg rod positions based on the chain orientation proposed by 
Sengupta \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03}, 
%calculated using the thin rod model developed in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_model},
are inconsistent with the measured Bragg rod positions in our nGIWAXS data.
Sengupta \textit{et al.} proposed the chain packing based on their analysis of the 
LAXS data from the unoriented sample \cite{ref:Wack89}:
specifically,  
the best fit value of the model parameter $\psi$,
which allows rotation of the transbilayer electron density profile with respect to 
the stacking $z$ direction (see Sec.~\ref{sec:transbilayer}) 
\cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03}. 
However, as we emphasized in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_phases_results},
a model should only be used to obtain the phase factors, and the model parameter
values should not be used to infer the actual bilayer structure.
Indeed, we also obtained the best fit $\psi$ value similar to the one obtained in 
\cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03} (Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_models}), 
and naive interpretation of the $\psi$ value would
lead to the same chain tilt proposed in \cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03}.
However, the nGIWAXS analysis led to a quite different chain tilt angle.
This problem of inferring the actual structure from the model parameters 
was also evidenced by the values of the ripple amplitude $A$ measured 
from the calculated
electron density maps in Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_DHH}, which were more than
3 \AA\ smaller than the model parameter $A$ obtained from the best fits
in Table~\ref{tab:LAXS_models}.
Thus, WAXS is essential for determining molecular organization.
The combination of LAXS and WAXS analyses yields more structural information 
than either technique alone.

Our proposed chain packing shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:major-arm_cartoon} (top)
compares favorably with the chain packing in the major arm predicted by
a Landau-Ginzburg theory developed by Kamal \textit{et al.} 
that allows a coupling of the lipid tilt field to the chain conformation field
\cite{ref:Kamal11}.
Interestingly, this theory paper \cite{ref:Kamal11} states that its results 
agree with the chain packing reported in \cite{ref:Sengupta03}. 
However, \cite{ref:Sengupta03} showed the chains in the major arm aligned along 
the local normal as reproduced in Fig.~\ref{fig:major-arm_cartoon}, in
disagreement with Fig.~5 in \cite{ref:Kamal11} which agrees with our result 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:major-arm_cartoon}. The chains in the minor arm in \cite{ref:Kamal11} 
are portrayed as disordered fluid-like, also in disagreement with \cite{ref:Sengupta03}.  
We discuss the chain packing in the minor arm in the next subsection.
In view of the successful prediction of \cite{ref:Kamal11} of our new result 
for the major arm, this theory should provide insights into what causes the 
ripple phase. Unfortunately, there are 18 parameters in this Landau-Ginzburg 
theory. While many of the terms are understandable, others are difficult to 
interpret in terms of interactions between lipid molecules.

The chain-chain correlation length can be estimated by using the Scherrer equation 
\cite{ref:Warren69},
\[
  B = \frac{0.94\lambda}{L\cos\theta},
\]
where $B$ is the observed FWHM of a Bragg peak, $\lambda$ is the wavelength,
$L$ is the length over which chains are positionally correlated, 
and $\theta$ is the Bragg angle. For the (2, 0) Bragg peak in
the gel L$_{\beta I}$ phase, we obtained the FWHM $\Delta q = 0.014$ \AA$^{-1}$ and
the position of the peak $q$ = 1.479 \AA$^{-1}$. For our X-ray wavelength
$\lambda$ = 1.175 \AA, the Scherrer equation yields $L$ = 426 \AA. 
Because the width of the (2, 0) gel phase peak 
was not instrumentally resolved, the correlation length of chains was 
greater than 426 \AA.
The (2, 0) Bragg peak width of a 
similar lipid, DPPC, was resolved and had a correlation 
length of 2900 \AA \cite{ref:Sun94}.

In contrast, the observed ripple phase WAXS 
peaks were instrumentally 
resolved (Fig.~\ref{fig:strong_peak}). 
The FWHM of the stronger peak was estimated to be 0.025 \AA$^{-1}$,
corresponding to a correlation length of $\sim$240 \AA,
indicating that the correlation length in the ripple phase is shorter 
than that in the gel phase.
This observation can be qualitatively understood by supposing that chains in the major
and minor arms are not correlated, so that gel phase-like chains in the 
major arm are only correlated within the major arm, limiting the correlation
length along the ripple direction to be less than the length of the major 
arm, $\sim$100 \AA. 
It is possible that chains are correlated over a much longer distance 
along the direction perpendicular to the ripple direction leading to
a sharp reflection along $q_y$.
In the case of our in-plane powder sample, we would observe the convolution
of a broad width peak along $q_x$ and a sharp peak along $q_y$. 
Such a convolution would result in a broad Bragg rod,
qualitatively consistent with our nGIWAXS data.
To quantitatively understand the observed peak widths would require rigorously
modeling the finite size effect. This could lead to a prediction
for the peak shape that is not Gaussian as assumed by the Scherrer equation 
\cite{ref:Warren69}.

Next, we compare our chain packing results to the result of the
atomistic MD simulations by de Vries \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:deVries05}.
In their simulations, while chains were straightened out (all-trans) like in 
the case of the gel phase, their chain tilt angles $\theta$ were modulated 
along the ripple direction. It was also
clearly seen in their simulations that chains in the different leaflets were 
decoupled and tilted in opposite directions. Our tWAXS data are 
inconsistent with this picture and instead consistent with normal
gel phase packing where chains in different leaflets constitute long coherently
scattering entities.

\subsection{Minor Arm}
Some previous work has suggested that chains in the minor arm are disordered 
similarly to the L$_\alpha$ fluid phase \cite{ref:Schneider83,ref:Sun96,ref:Pabst04,ref:Riske09}.
Figure~\ref{fig:minor_comparison} compares our electron density profiles
in the minor arm to the DMPC fluid phase profile reported by 
K\v{u}cerka \textit{et al.} \cite{Kucerka05_BPJ}.
Unlike 
the case for the major arm, the density profile in the minor arm
is not quantitatively consistent with that of the fluid phase. 
However, as we discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:LAXS_edp}, the electron density profile
for the minor arm was less robust than for the major arm,
so correcting the phase factors might lead to a profile more similar 
to the one shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:minor_comparison} (middle).

While the electron density profiles obtained through LAXS data analysis
are not very supportive of the fluid phase like minor arm,
our nGIWAXS data can be understood as scattering
arising from the gel like major arm and the fluid like minor arm. 
As Fig.~\ref{fig:strong_peak} and \ref{fig:weak_peak} show,
the nGIWAXS pattern is consistent with a superposition of 
the two Bragg rods due to the major arm and
a broad peak similar to the fluid phase 
WAXS pattern shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fluid_qr}. 
Table~\ref{tab:nGIWAXS_summary} shows that 
the width of the diffuse scattering peak 
in the fluid phase is approximately twice
wider 
than the estimated width of the broad peak in the ripple phase.
This difference can be understood by assuming that chains in the minor arm
are less disordered than in the fluid phase, which would yield a narrower
scattering feature. 
This assumption is reasonable because the ripple phase is a lower temperature
phase than the fluid phase and the short length of the minor arm along the 
ripple direction might restrict the motion of disordered chains. 
This assumption would also explain why the estimated broad peak
$q$-position is larger than that of the fluid phase WAXS peak
(see Table~\ref{tab:nGIWAXS_summary});
less chain disordering results in a smaller average chain-chain
distance, leading to a larger $q$ value of the associated scattering.

The existence of the broad peak in the ripple nGIWAXS is based on the
assumption that the Bragg rod profiles in $q_r$ are Lorentzians 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:strong_peak} and ~\ref{fig:weak_peak}).
Since the $L_{\beta I}$ (2, 0) Bragg rod profile in $q_r$ was fitted very well
with a Lorentzian (Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_phase}), this functional form is
not unreasonable for the Bragg rods in the ripple phase.
The thin rod model considered in Sec.~\ref{sec:ripple_model} predicts
a delta function in $q_r$, and the Scherrer particle broadening leads to
a Gaussian profile \cite{ref:Warren69}. 
Therefore, supporting a Lorentzian profile would require
a more rigorous calculation of Bragg rod scattering including a finite size effect
due to the major arm shape and/or disordering of chains discussed in
Sec.~\ref{sec:waxs_results}. 

%Inconsistency of the minor arm being like the fluid phase is also seen in our nGIWAXS data.
%Figure~\ref{fig:fluid_vs_ripple} compares observed WAXS patterns of the ripple and 
%fluid phase. The fluid phase pattern was centered at $q_r$ = 1.4 \AA$^{-1}$, where
%there is no obvious feature in the WAXS pattern of the ripple phase. While one
%could argue that the fluid phase pattern can be scaled down to match the tail
%of the ripple Bragg peaks, thereby making the two consistent with each other, 
%as previously argued in Ref.~\cite{ref:Cunningham98}, 
%subtraction of the fluid phase pattern from the ripple pattern would result
%in an asymmetric shape of the ripple Bragg peaks, which is not very reasonable.

An interesting chain packing shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS_comparison} 
was reported from an MD simulation \cite{ref:deVries05} that 
introduced the 
possibility that the thinner minor arm might consist of interdigitated chains 
rather than disordered fluid chains.  
Figure~\ref{fig:minor_comparison} compares the electron density
profiles in the minor arm with that of the dihexadecylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) \LI\ interdigitated phase
reported by \cite{ref:Guler09}. Absence of the methyl trough can be seen in
both \LI\ phase and the ripple minor arm, but the widths of the
headgroups are much narrower in the DHPC \LI\ phase because the electron density
of the backbone is closer to that of water because there is no carbonyl group. The widths
of the ``headgroups'' in the minor arm profile are about 10 \AA, comparable
with those in the major arm profile shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gel_comparison} 
and in the $L_\alpha$ phase shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:minor_comparison} (middle).
Since each DHPC chain has two additional CH$_2$ groups compared to DMPC,
the bilayer thickness would be smaller by $2\times 1.27$~\AA\
if the chains in the ripple minor arm were interdigitated.

While Fig.~\ref{fig:minor_comparison}
suggests that interdigitated chains are not completely inconsistent with 
our results in terms of the overall density profile shape, 
our nGIWAXS pattern does not support the packing proposed in 
\cite{ref:deVries05}. Figure~\ref{fig:nGIWAXS_comparison} compares
their calculated WAXS pattern from the atomistic MD simulations
to our measured nGIWAXS pattern from the ripple phase. As noted in
\cite{ref:deVries05}, interdigitated chains in the minor arm scatter
coherently, giving rise to a Bragg rod centered at $q_z \approx$ 0.4 \AA$^{-1}$.
This off-equator Bragg rod would be due to chains being tilted by about 20\textdegree\
with respect to the stacking $z$ direction though they
are essentially parallel to the local bilayer normal.
We saw no sign of a Bragg rod at such a large $q_z$ value in our nGIWAXS
data. 
Moreover, the two observed Bragg rods can be understood as arising from
the chains in the major arm alone. 
Therefore, our nGIWAXS data do not support the structure proposed by
de Vries \textit{et al.} \cite{ref:deVries05} although
the electron density profiles in the minor arm shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:minor_comparison} are qualitatively consistent with
an interdigitated structure.
Resolving this conflict might require a more accurate electron density
map with correct phase factors, and/or a rigorous calculation of a WAXS pattern
from the minor arm, 
allowing a possibility to place an interdigitated chain lattice differently from
the simulation as we did for the hexagonal lattice in the major arm 
using the variable $\zeta$.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:ripple_conclusion}
We have obtained a high resolution electron density map for the asymmetric
DMPC ripple phase by analyzing the LAXS diffraction pattern collected with
synchrotron X-rays. 
While the phase factors for some of the weak observed peaks
remain ambiguous, the calculated electron density maps with various choices
of the ambiguous phase
factors clearly showed an out-of-plane structure similar to the gel phase
in the major arm. They also showed that the minor arm electron density profiles
do not resemble a typical fluid phase profile, but are more consistent with
interdigitated chains.
Measured ripple amplitudes, major and minor arm lengths and thicknesses
did not depend considerably on the various phase factors predicted by 
different models and fits, and were therefore robust. 
Our analysis also confirms that the major arm is twice longer than the minor arm.

A further effort should be made to obtain the correct phase factors for the 12 uncertain orders
with an approach similar to the pattern recognition method
and/or development of a model that better captures the details of the ripple
profile in the kink region. 
With the analysis detailed in this thesis,
more data at various hydration levels could elucidate the 
inter- and intra-bilayer interactions in this phase.
Measurements of the major arm thickness as a function of hydration
would also indicate whether the chain tilt angle is dependent on the hydration
as it is in the gel phase.
If chains in the minor arm are indeed interdigitated, the minor arm thickness
might be more or less constant.

Our unprecedented high resolution WAXS study on the ripple phase 
revealed for the first time
clear separation of the previously observed broad peak \cite{ref:Katsaras95}.
The observed Bragg rods were indexed using our thin rod model developed 
for the ripple phase and additional information obtained from the LAXS
analysis, showing that the chains in the major arm are 
tilted with respect to the bilayer normal (Fig.~\ref{fig:major-arm_cartoon});
this disagrees with the chain packing proposed in \cite{ref:Sengupta00,ref:Sengupta03}.
By combining the structural parameters obtained from the LAXS and WAXS studies,
we have suggested that chains in the major arm are slightly more 
disordered than all-trans chains.
The Bragg rod indexing suggests that the observed Bragg rods arise 
from the major arm, and not from interdigitated chains 
in the minor arm suggested from a MD simulation.
Our attempt in estimating the Bragg rod widths in the in-plane direction
also showed a sign of broad scattering underneath the Bragg rods,
which could be attributed to fluid like chains in the minor arm.

Future possible experiments
include a high resolution transmission experiment, where both geometric 
broadening and energy dispersion are minimized. The expected resolution 
is the width of the X-ray beam, which is about 3 pixels. This experiment 
would double the tWAXS resolution achieved in this work. 
Another slightly different high resolution experiment is to use a silicon 
crystal analyzer downstream of the sample, which removes geometric
broadening. The downside of this type of high resolution experiment is that
only one point in $q$-space is probed 
by each exposure, so getting a full
2D map of wide angle scattering is time consuming.  
With high resolution nGIWAXS or tWAXS experiments
close to full hydration, it might be possible to observe 
the $P_{\beta I}$ phase of the major arm. This would strongly support
our analysis of the nGIWAXS data,
which gives the $P_{\beta F}$ phase below full hydration.
Combining high resolution LAXS and WAXS data at various hydration levels
might be useful.

%Further analysis of the nGIWAXS data should be carried out 
%with a more sophisticated model that takes into account the finite size effect 
%due to the major-minor arm boundary and 
%the slight disordering of chains, possibly due to the gauche-trans-gauche kink.
%The calculated WAXS pattern from the major arm would disentangle the scattering 
%contribution from the major and minor arms, 
%leading to a deeper insight into the minor arm chain packing.

One could also calculate the WAXS pattern from the fluid like domains tilted 
with respect to the stacking $z$ direction. In doing so, in-plane powder averaging
should also be done, which would convolute the tilted ring patterns from 
tilted fluid domains in different directions. It would be interesting to
see where this would locate the diffuse scattering maximum,
on or off the equator.
 
%Our new data sets should also facilitate testing variations of already proposed 
%structures as well as new future structures.
%For example, Monte Carlo simulations based on a model free energy can be tuned
%to obtain a good fit to our measured wide angle data.
%One could also consider some exotic packing such as a swirling pattern observed
%in Ref.~\cite{ref:Watkins11}. Predicting the scattering
%intensity pattern from these structures might lead to a different way
%to analyze our LAXS and nGIWAXS data and possibly an improved study of the 
%ripple phase. 

%In this thesis, we only investigated the asymmetric ripple phase of DMPC.
%It is known that very similar lipid, DPPC, shows coexistence of 
%stable asymmetric and metastable symmetric phases. Detailed structural
%studies of the DPPC ripples may shed light on this intricate dependence 
%on the chain length, which may in turn lead to deeper insights to
%the origin and energetics of the ripple phase.

Also highly speculative, but the ripple phase might be an interesting phase
to study curvature sensing peptides. 
Curvature sensing peptides
may accumulate at the kink regions. Then, the electron density profile
can be calculated with the analysis detailed in this work. It would 
be very interesting if peptide-lipid interactions also significantly 
modify the wide angle pattern. With a known perturbation property of 
a peptide on lipids, it could shed light on the structure of the minor arm.
For example, if indeed chains are fluid like in the minor arm, some peptides
might accumulate in the minor arm because of the ease of 
insertion as compared to the gel-like major arm.
Then, the ripple phase might be used to study biologically relevant problems.

In conclusion, the LAXS, nGIWAXS, and tWAXS analysis led to strong support 
for chain packing in the major arm similar to the gel phase with coupled leaflets,
and clearly suggest different types of packing in the 
major and minor arms with
conflicting results regarding the minor arm packing.
Our study leads to more possible experiments and analyses, and should 
stimulate further research on the ripple phase, which continues to 
be mysterious and fascinating.
