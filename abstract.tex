Protein function essential for living organisms is regulated by cell membranes. 
The building blocks of cell membranes are the lipid bilayers, into which lipid 
molecules in water self-assemble. Lipid bilayers show rich phase behavior. 
Among the thermodynamic phases observed in lipid bilayer systems is the ripple 
phase where the ripple is asymmetric and sawtooth-like, consisting of a longer 
and shorter arm, connected by a kink. Study of the ripple phase properties 
contributes to our understanding of the balance of forces within the lipid 
bilayers and the resulting molecular organization. Various theories have been 
developed in order to explain the appearance of this kink, with each theory 
predicting different molecular organization within the lipid bilayers. However, 
the molecular organization in the ripple phase has not been determined yet. In 
this paper, we report the results of the high-resolution wide angle X-ray 
scattering from the ripple phase. The observed sharp peaks indicates that lipid 
molecules are tightly packed, exhibiting short-range order. Furthermore, the 
observed X-ray scattering pattern is consistent with slight disordering of 
lipids in the kink regions.
